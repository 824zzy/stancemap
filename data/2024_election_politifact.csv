politifact,"""Last time Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot” was Abraham Lincoln in 1860.","Former President Donald Trump’s inclusion on Republican primary ballots has been formally challenged in 35 states. Challengers have cited the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, Section 3, which prohibits anyone who engaged in insurrection from holding the office of president.     President Abraham Lincoln was not removed from general election ballots in 1860. At that time, political parties distributed their own ballots, which were single-party tickets, and some slaveholding states in the South did not print and hand out Republican ballots because there was little support for Lincoln in those places.       Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy.  Learn more.","Days before the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear former President Donald Trump’s appeal of his removal from Colorado’s March 5 Republican primary ballot, social media users compared his electoral plight with Abraham Lincoln’s in 1860. A  Jan. 26 Instagram post  reshared a video in which a man describes efforts to remove Trump from the ballot. The man compared the situation with the 1860 election, and said President Abraham Lincoln was removed from ballots. ""The last time Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot was 1860,"" he said. ""That candidate was Abraham Lincoln. He still went on to win, and the Civil War started the next year. He also won that."" He claimed that Trump was being removed from the ballot ""for saying the elections were rigged."" The video was originally shared by its creator in a  Dec. 20, 2023, Instagram post  that garnered more than 150,000 likes.  We have seen  numerous  similar  claims  in  recent  months,  comparing  efforts to remove Trump from ballots with Lincoln’s 1860 election. Many said that Lincoln was  removed  from ballots in 10 slaveholding states. One  TikTok video  shared a video of Fox News host and commentator Jesse Watters making the false claim  on his show . The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Like the Instagram video’s claim, the posts are wrong about why some are seeking to remove Trump from the primary ballot in dozens of states, and about Lincoln’s ballot status in 1860. Formal challenges to Trump’s inclusion on Republican primary ballots have been made in at least 35 states, according to a  New York Times review . Of those, only Colorado and Maine have taken steps to remove Trump from their state’s ballot, although those cases are being challenged in court. As of Feb. 3, 17 states have rejected efforts to remove Trump from the ballot, and cases in 16 states are unresolved, the Times said. The challenges are not for simply questioning the election results, as the Instagram video says, but over Trump’s actions on or before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.  In December, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump was ineligible for the White House and should be removed from the state’s Republican March 5 primary ballot based on  the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, Section 3 , which says that no person who has ""engaged in insurrection"" can hold the office of president.  The Colorado lawsuit was filed by a  group of Republican and independent voters . The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case Feb. 8, and a decision will likely impact challenges to Trump’s candidacy in other states. On Dec. 28, Maine Secretary of State ​​Shenna Bellows, a Democrat,  unilaterally removed  Trump from the Republican primary ballot after three challenges by voters, also citing the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause. Trump has  appealed that decision  to a Maine Superior Court. Historians told PolitiFact that the claim comparing Trump’s ballot removals to the Lincoln era shows a misunderstanding about how general elections worked in the 1800s. (Primary elections  didn’t come into general use  in the U.S.  until the early 20th century .) Jonathan W. White, a Christopher Newport University American studies professor, said in the mid-19th century, political parties were responsible for printing and distributing their own ballots to supporters. Other experts said because there was little support for Lincoln in slaveholding Southern states, the Republican Party didn’t waste resources printing and handing out ballots there.  ""To be fair to the gentleman in the video, I've heard professional historians make the mistake of saying that ‘Lincoln wasn't on the ballot.’ The truth is that nobody banned him,"" White said. ""It's just that there weren't any Republican Party organizations, or voters, in most of the South, which meant that there wouldn't be any Republican ballots for Lincoln to be on."" Cecily Zander, a Texas Woman’s University assistant history professor, said after being ""frustrated"" by the ""erroneous"" comparison, she wrote a  blog post about it  on Emerging Civil War, a website that shares scholarly articles about the Civil War. Voters in Lincoln’s 1860 election would have submitted a ""party ticket"" — supplied by their party — in the ballot box at their polling place, Zander wrote. That ticket wouldn’t include candidates from opposing parties, only the candidates for one party. Because the Republican party didn’t expect a large number of votes in places such as Alabama or Mississippi, which at the time were majority Democratic, it didn’t distribute tickets in those states, she wrote. ""It was a waste of time and resources to send thousands of Lincoln ballots to the South, just to have them sit in unopened boxes on Election Day,"" Zander wrote. She shared an image of an 1860 Republican ticket in Iowa in her post, and more examples can be seen on this  National Museum of American History webpage .  Louis Masur, a Rutgers University American studies and history professor, said Democrats didn’t remove Lincoln from ballots. He didn’t appear because the Republican party ""in effect, did not exist in those states."" A man in an Instagram video said, ""Last time Democrats removed a Republican from the ballot"" was Lincoln in 1860. Comparisons with Lincoln’s 1860 election ignore the differences between elections then and now, historians said. Political parties were responsible for providing single-party tickets to voters; Republicans had little support in the South, so chose not to distribute tickets in some states.  No ballot featured candidates from multiple parties, like those used in today’s general elections, so Lincoln could not have been removed from one. The claim is False.",false,Instagram posts,2024-01-26,2024-02-06,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/trumplincoln/9abca71c96fac8df88d39b2a635b1845.jpeg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/feb/06/instagram-posts/abraham-lincoln-wasnt-removed-from-1860-ballots-co/,"Elections, History, Facebook Fact-checks, Instagram posts"
politifact,Biden’s strategy is to “get as many illegals in the country as possible” and “legalize them to create a permanent majority.”,"It can take a decade or longer for an immigrant to become a U.S. citizen, a requirement to vote in federal elections.     On his first day as president, Joe Biden asked Congress to create a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But the current Senate bill, which Biden supports, would not do that.      There is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote for Democrats.      Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy.  Learn more.","Days before senators unveiled a immigration bill aimed at slowing illegal immigration, Elon Musk riffed on a common myth that Democrats want mass illegal immigration to gain more voters.  ""Biden’s strategy is very simple: 1. Get as many illegals in the country as possible. 2. Legalize them to create a permanent majority – a one-party state,""  Musk posted Feb. 2 on X . ""That is why they are encouraging so much illegal immigration. Simple, yet effective.""  Over one week, Musk posted about  immigration  about two dozen times; another post said that "" every deportation is a lost vote. "" The morning after a trio of bipartisan senators unveiled the immigration bill,  Musk wrote , ""The long-term goal of the so-called ‘Border Security’ bill is enabling illegals to vote! It will do the total opposite of securing the border."" Musk’s statement echoes a recent statement by former President Donald Trump, who said, ""That’s why they are allowing these people to come in — people that don’t speak our language — they are signing them up to vote."" We rated that  Pants on Fire .  Such statements align with  conspiracy theories  about the "" great replacement ,"" which claim white people of European descent are deliberately being replaced with nonwhite people.  Musk provided no evidence to show such a Biden strategy exists. And the claim doesn’t add up, because it takes immigrants years to become U.S. citizens, and there’s no guarantee that immigrants who gain citizenship will vote for Democrats.  We emailed the X press account and received an automatic reply saying, ""busy now, please check back later.""  Musk called this alleged strategy ""very simple"" and ""effective,"" but it’s neither.  Federal law requires citizenship as a condition to vote in national elections. Gaining citizenship can take a decade or longer.  Interacting with the government, including trying to vote, is something immigrants in the country illegally try to avoid, Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist,  previously told PolitiFact : ""They are not going to go register to vote and expose themselves."" Occasionally, noncitizens  have been prosecuted for voting . When noncitizens register to vote, it is often in error. Musk’s X post included a screenshot of a January 2021  Associated Press article  about Biden’s plan to ask Congress to create a path for citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But Biden’s efforts  stalled  because his proposed 2021 bill did not advance. Biden has said if it passes, he will sign the  new Senate legislation  that is considerably tougher on immigration. If fully implemented, the proposed legislation would decrease the number of immigrants permitted into the country because of its higher standard to be considered for asylum.  It’s unclear whether the bill has the votes to pass the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said it is dead on arrival. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said the new legislation ""does not provide any path to citizenship for anyone currently in the country illegally and would not in any way expedite legal permanent residence for any future border arrivals."" ""It takes on average 5 years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Mittelstadt said. And there is no guarantee that immigrants who become citizens will vote for Democrats.  Experts have  told us  it’s ridiculous to make assumptions about how immigrants crossing the border now will vote in the future if they gain citizenship. Since Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, the platform now known as X has  removed guardrails  designed to restrict the flow of mis- and disinformation.  It’s easy to discount such ""conspiracy theory nonsense"" from random trolls on X, but it’s powerful when it comes from Musk who owns the platform, said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, a group that advocates for voting rights. Democracies require participation, and falsehoods ""only increase the likelihood that people will lose faith in our elections and simply opt out,"" Gutierrez said. Musk said Biden’s strategy is to ""get as many illegals in the country as possible"" and ""legalize them to create a permanent majority.""  The path to U.S. citizenship, which is required for voting in federal elections, can take a decade, so the current influx of immigrants would not lead to a significant number of new voters for many years, if ever.  Even when immigrants become voting citizens, it doesn’t mean the United States will become a one-party nation.  Biden currently supports a Senate immigration bill that does not create a broad path to citizenship.  We rate this statement False.   RELATED :  No, the Senate immigration bill does not allow 5,000 people to illegally enter the U.S. daily RELATED :  Trump's claim that millions of immigrants are signing up to vote illegally is Pants on Fire!

politifact,“I cooperated far more” than Joe Biden in the classified documents investigations.,"President Joe Biden’s lawyers immediately notified federal officials when they found documents, and Biden also consented to searches of his homes and offices. Biden sat for a five-hour interview with the special counsel.     Trump refused to turn over documents and enlisted others’ help to destroy or hide evidence, an indictment stated.      Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy.

""I did nothing wrong, and I cooperated far more,"" Trump wrote in a Feb. 8  statement . It will be up to a jury to decide whether Trump did ""nothing wrong."" But his statement that he cooperated far more than Biden is absurd. Robert Hur, the special counsel who investigated Biden, summarized Trump’s lack of cooperation in a report about Biden’s case. ""Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite,""  Hur wrote . ""According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview and in other ways cooperated with the investigation.""  Trump’s spokesperson did not respond to PolitiFact for this fact-check.  A  timeline  of the Biden investigation that PolitiFact created based on news reports and statements by Biden lawyers showed that his lawyers quickly alerted federal officials after finding the documents. Biden also cooperated with federal law enforcement searches of his homes and offices. Nov. 2, 2022 : Biden’s lawyers discovered documents, some classified, in a locked closet at Biden’s post-vice presidential office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C. They found the documents while cleaning out the office.  That same day , the White House Counsel’s Office notified the National Archives and Records Administration and the agency took the materials Nov. 3. Nov. 14, 2022 : Attorney General Merrick Garland  directed  John Lausch, a U.S. attorney in Chicago, to conduct an initial investigation.  At some point in November 2022 : The FBI searched the Penn Biden Center with the Biden team’s consent, according to Jan. 31, 2023, news reports by  CBS  and other outlets that did not name sources.  CNN  reported that a search warrant was not used, which is a sign that Biden’s team cooperated. Dec. 20, 2022 : Biden’s personal attorneys searched his Wilmington, Delaware, home’s garage and found more records. The attorneys notified Lausch so the Justice Department could arrange to take the documents.  Jan. 12, 2023 : Garland appointed Hur as special counsel. January and February 2023 : On Jan. 20, 2023, the FBI searched Biden’s Wilmington home and found more documents. A Feb. 1, 2023, search of Biden’s home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware turned up no classified documents. In a statement about the Feb. 1 search, Biden’s personal attorney Bob Bauer said that DOJ ""sought to do this work without advance public notice, and we agreed to cooperate."" Oct. 8-9, 2023 : Biden sat for a voluntary interview with Hur. The interview ""lasted more than five hours,""  Hur wrote , and Biden ""provided written answers to most of our additional written questions."" The  Trump timeline ​​ we wrote based on news reports and court records of his charges showed that Trump tried to thwart federal officials. May 6, 2021 : National Archives and Records Administration’s chief counsel emailed Trump’s representatives seeking missing records, a  search warrant showed .  December 2021 : A search warrant stated that NARA continued to make requests of Trump representatives until late December, when the agency was advised that 12 boxes were ready for retrieval. January 2022 : The National Archives  retrieved 15 boxes  of records from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, Florida, home. The National Archives  said  Trump had ""torn up"" some of the presidential records. April 29 and May 1, 2022 : A lawyer wrote letters on Trump’s behalf requesting that the National Archives delay the disclosure to the FBI of the retrieved records. Acting archivist Debra Steidel Wall  denied this request  and stated that the boxes contained ""over 100 documents with classified markings, comprising 700 pages."" May 11, 2022 : Trump accepted a grand jury subpoena seeking classified documents. The  indictment  states that Trump told his attorney, ""I don’t want anybody looking through my boxes"" and ""What happens if we just don’t respond at all or don’t play ball with them?"" and ""Wouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?"" Between May 23 and June 2, 2022 : At Trump’s direction, his personal aide Walter Nauta moved 64 boxes from a Mar-a-Lago storage room to Trump’s residence, according to the  indictment . June 2, 2022 : A Trump attorney reviewed the documents in the Mar-a-Lago storage room and met with Trump. The  attorney said  that Trump made a plucking motion and told the attorney he should take the documents to his hotel room, and if there was anything ""really bad in there,"" pluck it out. June 3, 2022 : Justice Department officials briefly met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and retrieved more documents marked classified. A Trump lawyer signed a declaration saying that all the materials marked classified were turned over. But investigators later learned there were more records and that same month subpoenaed Trump again, seeking surveillance footage.  Aug. 8, 2022 : The FBI, with a  search warrant ,  searched Mar-a-Lago , removing 25 more boxes of documents. Days later, Garland said that the Justice Department had exhausted efforts to retrieve the material in other ways. ""Where possible, it is standard practice to seek less intrusive means as an alternative to a search, and to narrowly scope any search that is undertaken."" The  indictment  said that the search followed Trump’s refusal to cede records.  Trump was indicted in June 2023 on about  three dozen counts , including charges of willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and making false statements.  ""Trump endeavored to obstruct the FBI and the grand jury investigations and conceal his continued retention of classified documents,"" the indictment said. It said Trump did this by: ""Suggesting that his attorney falsely represent to the FBI and grand jury that Trump did not have the documents called for by the grand jury subpoena."" Directing Nauta ""to move boxes of documents to conceal them from Trump’s attorney, the FBI and the grand jury."" (Nauta was also charged.) ""Suggesting that his attorney hide or destroy documents"" called for by the subpoena. Giving the FBI and the grand jury some of the documents called for by the subpoena ""while claiming he was cooperating fully."" Causing the submission of a certification to the FBI and grand jury ""falsely representing"" that all documents had been produced. Comparing himself with Biden, Trump said, ""I cooperated far more"" in his classified documents investigation. Government records rebut his statement.  Biden lawyers alerted federal officials on the same day they found the documents, and Biden cooperated with searches and sat for an interview for the special counsel’s investigation.  Trump’s indictment shows he failed to cooperate on multiple occasions. He refused to return documents for months and enlisted others to hide or destroy evidence. Trump once asked his attorney, according to the indictment, ""Wouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?""

Authorities are investigating it, which means to me they may suspect foul play."" The post’s caption says, ""This young woman is referring to the real meaning behind Joe Biden’s cryptic tweet after the Super Bowl."" In a Feb. 12  Instagram video , a man suggests that Biden orchestrated the accident to create a financial crisis leading up to the 2024 election, pointing to what he says are a series of similarities when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out before the 2020 election.  Both posts refer to a  Feb. 11 tweet  from Biden’s official X account that shows the president with glowing red eyes and includes the caption, ""Just like we drew it up."" The image was  a joke  and referred to  a conspiracy theory  that the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl win was planned so Taylor Swift, the girlfriend of Chiefs player Travis Kelce, could endorse Biden for the 2024 presidency.  Aviation experts told news outlets that poor weather — not Biden — likely was to blame for the fatal helicopter crash.  The Associated Press  reported  that on Feb. 9, Herbert Wigwe, the CEO of Access Bank in Nigeria, his wife and son, two pilots and the former chair of the Nigerian stock exchange, died in a helicopter crash in Southern California’s Mojave Desert. The plane’s destination was Boulder City, Nevada, 26 miles southeast of Las Vegas, where Super Bowl LVIII was played Feb. 11. An accident investigation is ongoing, but aviation experts  told  AP that the flight should have been canceled because of poor nighttime weather conditions in the desert. A mix of rain and snow during the flight could have led to low visibility, and there are few lights in the Mojave Desert.  ""If I were in charge, I certainly would have said ‘No, thank you’"" to flying, aviation safety consultant Pete Field told AP.  Gary Hufbauer, a Peterson Institute for International Economics economist, said the claim that the helicopter accident was planned to create a global financial crisis is ""bizarre."" The Nigerian CEO’s death would not affect the global economy, he said.   Wigwe and his associates were flying in a helicopter privately chartered by Orbic Air.  Harvard University Risk and Audit Services  found that flying on a chartered aircraft is more dangerous than flying on a commercial aircraft because charter operators are less regulated.  In 2013, a lawsuit was filed against Orbic Air, claiming one of its helicopters was negligently operated after a man died in a crash,  CBS reported  at the time.

WWE performances are scripted and dramatized; the boos were because of Johnson’s role as a villain in Philadelphia at WrestleMania 40, Johnson said in an X post.

politifact,"Says Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde claims he ""understands the tragedy of children being trafficked through Central America because he owns three homes there.""","Although Heartland Signal’s post on X suggested that Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde owns private residences in Central America, that’s not what the new U.S. Senate candidate was referring to when he spoke during his campaign announcement about the dangers children face when they are trafficked.      He was talking about Hovde Homes, a project from his company’s charitable foundation that builds shelters for vulnerable children across the world, including those who have been trafficked.      There’s not much information available online about these shelters besides their locations — Guatemala and Honduras among them.      Heartland Signal, too, seemed to recognize the mischaracterization. In a follow-up X post, they clarified he appeared to be talking about Hovde Homes.","Republican businessman Eric Hovde  jumped in the race for one of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate seats  Tuesday, setting up a contest with U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, and prompting a wash of criticism of his background and motivations. One such criticism — from Heartland Signal, a digital newsroom anchored to a progressive Chicago radio station – lacked some key context.  Heartland Signal  shared a snippet of Hovde’s announcement event on X , in which the candidate spoke about the horrors of human trafficking. ""My brother and I have homes all over the world, and we have three in Central America, that deal with issues like this,"" Hovde said. In the post, Heartland Signal wrote that ""Eric Hovde says he understands the tragedy of children being trafficked through Central America because he owns three homes there.""  That paints a bit of a misleading picture, especially given that Democrats and allies have portrayed Hovde as a carpetbagger, citing his owning residences in  California  and  Washington, D.C .   Let’s dive in.  Other X users,  including Milwaukee Journal Sentinel state politics reporter Jessie Opoien , were quick to point out what Heartland Signal left out. The homes Hovde referenced are shelters financed by his company’s charitable giving foundation, not residences as the post suggests.  According to the foundation’s website , Hovde ""has financed and oversees the construction and operation of Hovde Houses, which are homes that provide shelter, supportive services, education and love to vulnerable street children.""  The website of Hovde’s company, Hovde Properties , describes them as providing ""shelter, care, education and love to vulnerable children that were abandoned on the street or trafficked."" It also refers to them as Hovde Homes.  Hovde’s campaign website also mentions the shelters  under a section titled ""Hovde’s Heart."" Twelve shelters have been completed to date in Bolivia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Peru, Rwanda and Wisconsin, according to the site, and one is in progress in Costa Rica.  Beyond the above, little information exists online about the shelters.  A 2014 Wisconsin State Journal article  says Hovde opened the first one in Mexico City in 2006, which had served more than 200 homeless children.  Still, it’s clear that those were the homes he was referencing, not private homes.  It appears that Heartland Signal, too, realized the distinction.  ""While not mentioned in his speech, Hovde appears to be referring to his charitable foundation, Hovde Homes,"" they  replied  to the original X post.  Progressive outlet Heartland Signal claimed that ""Eric Hovde says he understands the tragedy of children being trafficked through Central America because he owns three homes there.""  The homes he spoke of are shelters for vulnerable children, not residences. The original post left that distinction up to the public to suss out.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  That fits here.   ",barely-true,Heartland Signal,2024-02-20,2024-02-22,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/feb/22/heartland-signal/yes-gop-senate-candidate-eric-hovde-owns-homes-in/,"Children, Elections, Wisconsin, Heartland Signal"

The Nevada secretary of state said the glitch had nothing to do with vote tabulation and did not affect the election results.

A Feb. 19  Instagram post  shared a screenshot of an X post that says, ""Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by former President Jimmy Carter found vote by mail to be ‘the largest source of potential voter fraud.’ The media will try to gaslight you into believing there are no issues with it but they are misleading the American people."" The X post shared a link to a  Las Vegas Review-Journal  article, and text with the article link said, ""Numerous Nevada voters looked at their voter history and found that their mail ballots were counted in the recent primary, even though they didn't participate in it.""  (Screengrab from Instagram) The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The full Review-Journal article explained that a database coding glitch occurred but did not affect election results.  In Nevada, all voters receive mail ballots for each election they are qualified to participate in, unless a voter opts out. A majority of voters in Nevada cast ballots by mail. The Instagram post linked the recent Nevada database glitch to voter fraud, but Nevada election officials said the two are unrelated.   ""I want to be clear that this issue had nothing to do with the tabulation of votes or results of any election,"" Secretary of State Francisco V. Aguilar, a Democrat, said in a Feb. 22  statement . ""There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in our state, now or ever."" Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo,  posted Feb. 19 on X,  ""The voter history glitch on the website does not impact vote tabulation, which happens at the county level,"" and shared a link to an article with that information.  Both the Instagram post and the X post it shared were from  Sean Parnell , a former Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump before dropping out in 2021. Parnell is a U.S. Army veteran who hosts a  podcast . We asked Parnell to send us evidence that voter fraud occurred in Nevada. He replied in an email that the point of his Instagram post was that ""mail in voting is not the best way to conduct an election. It is also not the best way to build confidence in the electorate, the latest issue in Nevada is just one recent example."" (Parnell’s full response is linked at the end of this story.) Other people echoed Parnell’s claim. Elizabeth Helgelien, a Nevada Republican congressional candidate, said in a Feb. 18  X post  that her online voter history showed she voted in the primary, although she did not. Helgelien said ""voter fraud"" appears to be happening in Nevada.  Nevada held its presidential preference primary Feb. 6. President Joe Biden won the Democratic primary while ""none of these candidates"" received the most votes in the Republican primary — more than former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Former President Donald Trump did not appear on the ballot because he competed in the caucus instead. About two weeks after the primary, voters notified the secretary of state’s office that, although they did not participate in the primary, the state’s website showed in their vote history that they had cast mail ballots. The secretary of state’s office said in a Feb. 21  memo  that a miscommunication in computer code caused the glitch, ""based on the state and counties interpreting the same data in different ways.""  Nevada has a ""bottom-up"" voter registration system in which counties send copies of their voter registration files to the state nightly via a secure upload. The state then stitches together 17 files from different systems and combines them into a statewide file. The counties use the mail ballot code ""MB."" Until the 10th day after an election, the state database interprets ""MB"" to mean that a mail ballot has been sent to a voter. After the 10th day, the system interprets the ""MB"" code to mean the mail ballot was counted. In prior elections, counties took steps to ensure that this code was applied only to ballots of people who had voted. But some of those steps did not happen after the Feb. 6 presidential preference primary, the memo said. The coding issue didn’t affect the election results, the memo said.  Bottom-up systems have not been considered a best practice for decades, and the state will move to a new ""top-down"" system before this June’s primary election, in accordance with a 2021 law passed by the Legislature.  Voter fraud  occasionally occurs, but on a  very small scale  and not enough to change the outcome in a presidential election. After Biden won Nevada in the 2020 presidential election,  the state’s Republican party  shared a story about a Republican voter, Donald Kirk Hartle, who claimed someone cast a mail ballot in his dead wife’s name. Hartle himself later pleaded guilty to one count of voting more than once in an election, because he had cast the ballot in his dead wife’s name.  The Heritage Foundation’s  database of voter fraud  shows only one other Nevada voter fraud conviction since 2020. Craig Frank was convicted in 2021 after voting in both Nevada and Arkansas during the 2016 general election. Parnell also sent us a 2012  New York Times  article that said, ""While fraud in voting by mail is far less common than innocent errors, it is vastly more prevalent than the in-person voting fraud that has attracted far more attention, election administrators say."" The article included anecdotal examples including a woman in Hialeah, Florida, who was charged with forging an elderly voter’s signature and possessing 31 completed absentee ballots, more than allowed under local law. Election website glitches or  clerical errors   occasionally   have   happened  in other jurisdictions. But these problems are typically from human error, and do not signal fraud. The Instagram post says that the ""Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by former President Jimmy Carter found vote by mail to be ‘the largest source of potential voter fraud.’""  Republican critics  of voting by mail, including  Trump , pluck one sentence from a 2005 report Carter co-wrote that said, ""absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud."" Although the nearly 20-year-old  report  generally communicated a dim view of absentee voting, it didn’t call for its elimination. Instead, it recommended ways to improve security and called for further research.  Since then, security improvements have been implemented, including: Some states have passed laws to  limit who can return a mail ballot  on behalf of another voter. States have added technologies so voters can track their own mail ballots.  Many states are part of a  consortium  to share voter registration data to flag outdated registrations, reducing the chance that a mail ballot is sent to someone who has died or who is no longer eligible to vote at that address. In 2020 and 2021, Carter defended the use of voting by mail. He  said  that given advances in the process, he believed it could be conducted ""in a manner that ensures election integrity."" Carter said he had cast mail ballots for years. An Instagram post said a Nevada database glitch showing voters cast ballots when they didn’t is evidence that voting by mail is ""the largest source of potential voter fraud."" A database coding glitch issue meant that some Nevada voters saw an inaccurate vote history online — showing their mail ballots as counted even if the voters did not vote —   after the Feb. 6 presidential preference primary. The Nevada secretary of state said the glitch was unconnected to vote tabulation and did not affect the election results.   The post’s quote comes from a report Carter co-wrote in 2005 that highlighted mail voting’s vulnerabilities but did not call for its elimination. Since then, security improvements to voting by mail have been implemented.  Carter has since said that voting-by-mail safeguards have advanced, that mail-in-voting can be done safely and that he votes by mail himself. We rate this statement False.  CORRECTION,  Feb. 24 : An earlier version of this story said Parrnell did not reply to our request for comment.

politifact,“North Carolina has the longest voting period in the country … and we have the most ways of voting.”,"In general elections, North Carolina distributes ballots before any other state.  	  For primary elections, though, the state's voting period doesn't stand out.   	  Election experts added: Offering a variety of voting options doesn't necessarily mean a state makes voting easy.","A Democratic congresswoman from North Carolina says the battleground state offers voters more time to participate in elections than in any other state.  U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross on Jan. 25  announced  a  bill  to make each state’s congressional redistricting processes more transparent — an effort that follows a contentious redistricting effort in her home state. North Carolina legislators on both sides of the aisle have a  history of drawing  new election maps behind closed doors, raising suspicion among opponents that they’re influenced by outside political groups.  Ross concluded a recent press conference by addressing the media, ""Please remind your readers and your viewers that you can start voting in the primary already."" She added, ""North Carolina has the longest voting period in the country, because we’re a military state, and we have the most ways of voting."" North Carolina is home to several military bases. To comply with  federal voting laws  accommodating members of the military, the state mails absentee ballots to eligible U.S. citizens overseas  at least 45 days  before an election.  We wondered about the timeframe for civilian voters, though. Does North Carolina offer the longest voting period in the nation?  The answer: for one major type of election — but not for the other. To judge voting periods, Ross measured the length of time between two dates: when absentee ballots are mailed to voters, and the final day a ballot can be postmarked. PolitiFact North Carolina also considered the final day an absentee ballot could be accepted.  To check Ross’ claim, we relied on information from the  National Conference of State Legislators , a bipartisan organization advocating for the interests of state governments. The NCSL tracks election laws in each state. We also contacted election officials in states that appeared to have some of the longest voting periods. General elections : When it comes to general elections — typically held in November on even-numbered years — North Carolina stands out. North Carolina  is the only state that mails absentee ballots to voters 60 days before the general election. North Carolina elections officials will begin mailing out absentee ballots on Sept. 6 for the Nov. 5 general election. Delaware  state law  allows for absentee ballots to be sent up to 60 days in advance of a general election, as the  NCSL  noted. But that’s not what happens in practice, according to the office of Delaware’s state election commissioner. Absentee ballots are typically mailed 30 to 45 days before an election, a spokeswoman for the Delaware office told PolitiFact. North Carolina also stands apart from Delaware and other states because it’s a "" no-excuse "" absentee state — meaning any voter can request an absentee ballot without providing a reason, such as being sick or out of town. In other words, for general elections, North Carolina has the longest voting period in the nation that’s open to every registered voter. Primary elections : North Carolina’s absentee voters have comparatively less time to fill out their ballot during primary elections.  North Carolina  state statutes  instruct elections boards to mail absentee ballots 50 days before a primary and allow the state elections board to shorten the window to 45 days. That’s what the board voted to do  this year  to account for the federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday on Jan. 15. North Carolina started mailing out absentee ballots  Jan. 19  for the March 5 primary.  Compared with other states, North Carolina’s 45-day primary voting period is long — but it’s not the longest. Here are some states that caught our attention: Alabama  allows absentee voting to start 55 days ahead of its elections.  Eligible  absentee voters started receiving ballots on Jan. 10 for the March 5 primary, Jeff Elrod, the state’s director of elections, told PolitiFact. Wisconsin  separates its presidential primary from others. Although absentee ballots will be mailed to civilians less than a month before the April 2 presidential preference election, they’ll go out  47 days ahead  of the Aug. 13 primary for congressional and legislative races.  South Dakota’s  absentee voting window is 46 days long. The state will begin mailing ballots on April 19 for its June 4 primaries, said Rachel Soulek, director of elections for the Secretary of State’s office. Elections officials in  Michigan  and  Pennsylvania  told us that it’s possible for absentee ballots to be mailed 50 days before a primary, but that delivery dates vary by county and ballots don’t always go out that early. Like North Carolina,  Minnesota  and  Virginia  began mailing out ballots on Jan. 19 ahead of their March 5 primaries. However, they allow ballots to arrive later than North Carolina does. In North Carolina, absentee and mail-in ballots must arrive  before polls close at 7:30  on Election Day. In  Minnesota , they’re due by 8 p.m. on Election Day. In  Virginia , they must be postmarked by Election Day but can be received as late as noon on the Friday following the election. Ross also said North Carolina offers the ""most ways of voting."" North Carolina does offer a  wide range of voting methods : absentee-by-mail, absentee through online portal (for military, eligible overseas and visually impaired voters), in-person early voting, in-person Election Day, curbside and provisional. At least a half dozen states — including Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Rhode Island, South Carolina and South Dakota — offer a similar menu of voting options as North Carolina, according to researchers for the  U.S. Vote Foundation , a voter education nonprofit. But offering the most voting options doesn’t necessarily mean that a state offers the easiest ballot access, said Andrew Garber, counsel for the Brennan Center’s Voting Rights and Elections Program. ""It’s difficult to compare the number of ‘ways’ different states have to vote because the voting rules across states differ in many nuanced ways,"" Garber said in an email. ""A state that has a lot of ‘ways’ to vote may still not be that accessible for its voters."" For example, a state may have in-person early voting but limit voting hours or offer only a few voting sites. North Carolina’s same-day voting registration rules offer another example, Garber said. The state offers same-day registration — which lets eligible residents register to vote at an early voting site and vote the same day. But new laws enacted last year instruct election officials to scrap a voter’s ballot if the county’s address verification form is returned to the elections board as undeliverable. The law, which is being challenged in court, disqualifies ballots from registered voters ""even after they (present) photo ID and proof of residence"" at the polls, Garber said. Ross said ""North Carolina has the longest voting period in the country … and we have the most ways of voting."" For general elections, that’s accurate. North Carolina is the only state that requires absentee ballots to be sent 60 days before Election Day. But this year, the state’s voting window for this year’s primary elections does not stand out. Ross’ claim about having the ""most ways"" of voting could also give North Carolinians the impression the state offers the easiest ballot access. That’s not necessarily the case as other states have similar offerings. Ross’ claim is partially accurate.

During a discussion about migrants entering the country, Trump said migrants are being allowed into the U.S. because the Biden administration ""maybe want(s) the votes,"" and that Democrats are trying to ""register people right now as we speak,"" a claim we previously rated  Pants on Fire !   Hannity  responded,  ""In New York City, for example, local elections, illegal immigrants can vote.""

But that law never took effect.  We contacted Fox News for comment and did not receive a reply. (Internet Archive) Trump’s speculation about registering immigrants in the country illegally to vote echoes the  discredited and racist  ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory that says Democrats support increased immigration as part of a plan to replace white people with nonwhite people.  Trump  and  other Republicans  have pushed the theory in recent months. In 2021, New York City lawmakers  approved  legislation that would have allowed  about 800,000  noncitizen New York residents  to vote  in municipal elections, if they had lived in the city for 30 days and were legal permanent residents of the U.S. or had work authorization.  The legislation   would have applied to local elections. Only  U.S. citizens  are allowed to vote in national elections. The New York City law was  immediately challenged  in court and never took effect. Nonetheless, it has been central to  false claims  that immigrants in the country illegally can vote in New York. In June 2022, before the law was scheduled to take effect, a New York judge  struck it down , saying the measure violated the state constitution’s  provision  that ""every citizen"" is entitled to vote. That decision was appealed. On  Feb. 21 , a New York  appeals court agreed  with the lower court’s decision: ""We determine that this local law was enacted in violation of the New York State Constitution and Municipal Home Rule Law, and thus, must be declared null and void.""  It is unclear whether the ruling will be appealed again.  Some cities across the U.S. have passed legislation to allow noncitizens to vote in some municipal elections, but that practice is  not widespread .  Hannity claimed in New York City ""local elections, illegal immigrants can vote."" New York City passed 2021 legislation that would have granted some noncitizens the right to vote in local elections.

politifact,"""There are less than two weeks until the deadline to register to vote in Wisconsin.""","Social media ads sponsored by Voto Latino say Wisconsin’s voter registration deadline is ""rapidly approaching"" and ""less than two weeks"" away.     The deadline to register online or by mail for the April 2 election is March 13, which was less than two weeks away when one ad was circulating.     But the ads don’t disclose that you can also register at your clerk’s office by March 29, or at the polls on Election Day in Wisconsin.","Wisconsin holds its presidential primary April 2. That’s long after many states hold their contests, including 15 states on March 5, Super Tuesday. But you might have seen recent ads on Instagram or Facebook that give the impression that Wisconsin’s primary is much earlier — or at least the deadline to register to vote in it. ""There are less than two weeks until the deadline to register to vote in Wisconsin,"" says one ad found Feb. 29 on Instagram. Another post advertised a few days later on Facebook read: ""Deadline rapidly approaching to register to vote in Wisconsin."" The ads are sponsored by Voto Latino, ""a civic engagement organization focused on educating and empowering a new generation of Latinx voters,"" according to its  website .  The nonprofit also advocates for liberal policy positions, such as paid sick leave and access to abortion. But as some online commenters pointed out, Wisconsin has ""same-day"" registration, meaning voters are able to register at the polls on April 2 — which is well over two weeks away.  Let’s clear up the deadlines to register to vote in the April presidential primary election in Wisconsin.  Voto Latino, which did not respond to an inquiry for this PolitiFact, seems to be referring to the deadline to register to vote online or by mail. Another video ad clarifies they’re talking about registering online. The  deadline  to register to vote online or mail a registration form before the April 2 election is March 13 — which was, at the time one of Voto Latino’s ads was circulating, less than two weeks away.   According to the  Wisconsin Elections Commission , you can register online or by mail up to 20 days before the election.  If you have a driver’s license or ID card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, you can register online at myvote.wi.gov.  Or, you can mail your local clerk a voter registration  form , which you can also start filling out at that website. But those two options, which have an upcoming deadline, aren’t your only chances to register to vote in the April primary.  The Wisconsin Elections Commission says you can also register in-person at your local clerk’s office ""up until the Friday before the election at 5:00 p.m. or close of business, whichever is later."" For this election,  that date  is March 29. Or, you can register at your polling place on Election Day. Polls are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. in Wisconsin.  Just remember to bring proof of residence with you — that can be a driver’s license or state-issued ID card if it has your current address, or a document like a lease, utility bill or bank statement. Bottom line: There are chances for you to register to vote all the way until April 2, or any Election Day in Wisconsin.  Recent social media ads sponsored by Voto Latino say Wisconsin’s voter registration deadline is ""less than two weeks"" away or ""rapidly approaching."" The ads give a false sense of urgency where there really is none. Voters who miss the ""rapidly approaching"" deadline might be led to believe they don’t have another chance to register. There is a March 13 deadline to register online or by mail. But there are two additional ways to register: at your clerk’s office through March 29, or at the polls April 2. The ads don’t disclose those options.

It can take many years for an immigrant to become a U.S. citizen, a requirement to vote in federal elections.     Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy.  Learn more.","Following news reports about immigrants in the U.S. illegally suspected in violent attacks in New York City and Georgia, Elon Musk accused Democrats of avoiding deportation to win at the ballot box. ""Dems won’t deport, because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point,""  Musk wrote on X Feb. 26 . ""That simple incentive explains what seems to be insane behavior."" Musk’s post also referred to immigrants illegally in the U.S. who are  accused  of assaulting New York City police officers. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat,  said  that the reported migrants who were recorded on video assaulting police should be deported.  Musk’s post shared another person’s X post about the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old University of Georgia nursing student who was killed Feb. 22 while on a run. Authorities  charged  Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old from Venezuela, with the murder.   U.S. Customs and Border Protection stopped  Ibarra when he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in September 2022, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ibarra was paroled in, allowing him to be released into the U.S. to await further immigration proceedings. The Nashville Tea Party, a conservative group, posted Musk’s statement on  Instagram  about a week later.  This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Musk has  repeatedly   posted   similar  statements  about Democrats ""importing voters"" or illegal immigrants and voters. These statements by  Musk  — and similar ones by  former President Donald Trump  and  J,D, Vance , now a Republican U.S. Senator from Ohio — are wrong. We contacted X’s press team asking for Musk’s evidence and received an automated response: ""Busy now, please check back later."" Presidents, including Democrats, have removed and returned immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally for years, as federal government data shows. David Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Musk’s statement is ""ludicrously untrue."" Bier pointed to data from the  Department of Homeland Security  showing that Biden and former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have returned, removed or expelled millions of people. During each of his terms, Obama removed and returned  more people  than Trump did.  There have been more than  3.6 million   removals, returns and expulsions  from February 2021, Biden’s first month in office, to September 2023, based on Department of Homeland Security estimates. Federal law  requires U.S. citizenship to vote  in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form that attests under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to vote. States can check  databases  to verify voters’ citizenship.  Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation or incarceration. There are incidents of noncitizens voting in elections, but they are sporadic among millions of votes cast in federal elections. Immigrants who cross the border illegally are typically looking for jobs and many are escaping poverty or crime — most don’t want to risk drawing government authorities’ attention by casting a ballot. ""There is a massive economic incentive to migrate here illegally,""  Bier wrote on X . ""There’s a massive economic disincentive to vote illegally."" As we explained in a  recent fact-check of Trump , fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license. But the number of people who fall into this category is ""minuscule,"" Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite  previously told us .  In 2020, federal prosecutors  charged 19 people  in North Carolina with voter fraud after they cast ballots mostly in the 2016 election. Sixteen people pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen; three cases were dismissed.  That was a big case, but more than 4.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2016 presidential election. It takes several years for an immigrant to become a citizen and gain voting rights. ""It takes on average five years in green card status before a person can become a U.S. citizen, so no one would instantly gain the right to vote,"" Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, previously told  PolitiFact . Not all immigrants who become citizens will vote. The  U.S. Census Bureau  reported that in the 2022 election, native-born citizen voter turnout was 53.4%, exceeding the 41.4% turnout of naturalized citizens. There is some evidence that immigrants lean left, but there are variations depending on their backgrounds and where they live.  A 2023  national poll by KFF and the Los Angeles Times  found that 37% of naturalized citizens say the Democratic Party represents their views better than the Republican party while 21% say the Republican Party does. But large shares of poll respondents leaned toward neither party.  But there is  no guarantee  that immigrants who become citizens in the future will vote for Democrats. Bier told us that ""there is zero evidence that immigration has harmed Republican Party prospects."" Congressional Republicans have performed much better during periods when the immigrant share of the population is high,  Bier wrote in 2019 . Musk said Democrats don’t deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally ""because every illegal is a highly likely vote at some point."" Musk provided no evidence to support his statement about deportation or voting. The Biden administration, and previous Democratic administrations, have deported millions of immigrants. Immigrants cannot vote until they become citizens, a process that takes several years. We rate this statement False.

politifact,“Eighty-two percent of the country understands that (the 2020 election) was a rigged election.”,,"GREENSBORO — Former President Donald Trump told his North Carolina supporters during a campaign stop that he’s not the only one who believes the 2020 presidential election was rigged against him. ""Eighty-two percent of the country understands that it was a rigged election,"" Trump said March 2 during a rally at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex. ""You can’t have a country with that. A poll came out: 82%. But they go after the people — they don’t go after the people that rig the election, they go after the people (that are) looking."" First, the 2020 election was not rigged and  numerous reviews  have confirmed that President Joe Biden won 51% of the vote. States certified the results. Congress accepted the results. Trump and his allies lost  more than 60 lawsuits  claiming otherwise. A group of conservatives, including former federal judges, examined every fraud and miscount claim by Trump and  concluded  that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results.""  Still, Trump has only amplified this false claim. Could he be right that now 82% of Americans are buying his line? We asked members of Trump’s campaign team about the 82% figure in Greensboro, but received no response. We searched the internet for a survey with that number from a credible polling company, but couldn’t find one. It reminded us of a 2022 check we did on a claim that 65% of Americans doubted the 2020 election, but we found that one to be  False .  Other   media   outlets  have also failed to substantiate his recent 82% figure. So, we asked polling experts across the nation: Is there any truth to Trump’s claim that up to 82% of Americans believe the 2020 presidential election was rigged? Their answer: No. Dave McLennan, director of the Meredith Poll at Meredith College in Raleigh said although several polls ask respondents whether the 2020 election was fair and legitimate, none of them show that a majority of Americans think that contest was fraudulent, ""much less 82%, as Trump claims. ""Even if you look at Republicans, the percentage that claim that the election was stolen is not as high as Trump claims,"" McLennan said in an email. Available data shows that Trump’s claim is ""absurd,"" Alexander Theodoridis, co-director of the UMass Amherst Poll at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said in an email.  A January  Umass Amherst Poll  found that 30% of respondents believed Biden’s win was illegitimate.  Theodoridis noted that even among former Republican members of Congress — who were involved in government and could access detailed information about elections — more than 80% said Biden’s victory was legitimate. Polling groups have surveyed Americans multiple times about the 2020 presidential election’s legitimacy  and none of their findings support Trump’s claim. Here’s a smattering of poll findings since we last examined this issue. A Washington Post-University of Maryland  poll  from December found that 36% of respondents viewed Biden’s win as illegitimate.  An August  poll  by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 70% of respondents believed Biden was legitimately elected. Among Republicans, the number was 57%.  A June Monmouth University  poll  found that 30% of respondents believe Biden won the 2020 election because of voter fraud. Among Republicans, the number was 68% — still lower than Trump claimed. That result ""has been a nearly constant percentage in Monmouth’s polling since the November 2020 election,"" Monmouth noted in its  report .  An early 2022 Axios-SurveyMonkey  poll  found that 55% respondents believed Biden won legitimately. SurveyMonkey and the AP-NORC polls have lower credibility ratings than Monmouth and The Washington Post with  FiveThirtyEight.com , which analyzes polling methods. Trump may have been referring to a  2021 survey  conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, a public opinion research firm.  Thirty-one percent of the poll’s respondents said they believed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump — but the number was much higher for respondents who consumed conservative media. Among Republicans who claimed they trust Fox News more than any other outlet, 82% said they believed the election was stolen.  Polling results consistently show a partisan divide over the election’s legitimacy, said Alejandra Campos, a Latino Studies professor in the University of Arkansas’ political science department. Still, ""the available data does not support the claim that a majority of Americans thought the 2020 election was rigged,"" Campos said. Trump said, ""82% of the country understands that it was a rigged election."" We couldn’t find any credible poll — or any group of polls — with results that support Trump’s claim. His campaign also produced no evidence to support it. Polling continues to show that most Americans believe the 2020 election was legitimate.  We rate Trump’s claim False.

Experts said in American politics, money is a necessary component of a winning campaign but not all-encompassing.

Learn more here.","After losing her California Senate bid on March 5, Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, used language reminiscent of  election   denialism  to cry foul.  Thanking her supporters in a  March 6 X post , Porter wrote: ""Because of you, we had the establishment running scared — withstanding 3 to 1 in TV spending and an onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election."" Thank you to everyone who supported our campaign and voted to shake up the status quo in Washington. Because of you, we had the establishment running scared — withstanding 3 to 1 in TV spending and an onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election. (1/) Facing criticism of her use of the term ""rig"" — including from Democrats — Porter later elaborated.  ""‘Rigged’ means manipulated by dishonest means,"" she  wrote  in a statement posted to X. ""A few billionaires spent $10 million+ on attack ads against me, including an ad rated ‘false’ by an independent fact checker. That is dishonest means to manipulate an outcome."" In that statement, she wrote, ""I said ‘rigged by billionaires’ and our politics are — in fact — ""manipulated by big dark money.""  ""At no time have I ever undermined the vote count and election process in CA, which are beyond reproach,"" she  added . Please find a statement from me below.  pic.twitter.com/as8H2cHWL8 When contacted for comment, a Porter campaign spokesperson pointed us back to her statement on X and to Merriam-Webster’s definitions of the verb ""rig,""  one of which  reads, ""to manipulate or control usually by deceptive or dishonest means."" Another of the definitions says ""rig"" is ""to fix in advance for a desired result."" Porter’s posts landed in a fraught political environment in which former President Donald Trump and his supporters have consistently asserted that the 2020 presidential election was ""rigged."" The allegations have been widely rebutted by the courts. PolitiFact has  repeatedly  rated false and  misleading  claims  about   ""rigged"" U.S. elections . Sometimes Democrats have joined in with similar language. In 2019, after Democrat Stacey Abrams lost the 2018 Georgia governor race to Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, Abrams  claimed  the ""system is rigged"" and repeatedly suggested the  election was stolen . (PolitiFact  found no proof  that voter suppression kept Abrams from winning the 2018 governor’s contest.)  Rigging an election  might refer  to buying votes, tampering with voting machines or stuffing a ballot box. In Porter’s case, she faced an onslaught of opposition spending, some of it by wealthy entities with little or no disclosure required. However, spending unlimited amounts of money to buy ads is legal, as long as the spenders do not coordinate with candidates.  Democracy and elections experts said people might disagree about whether such tactics should be legal, but this spending did not assure Porter’s loss or amount to a ""rigged"" election. California uses an unusual top-two primary system in which the candidates who finish in first and second place both  advance  to the general election — regardless of their party affiliation. Although votes are still being counted, Porter is headed toward a  third-place finish  behind Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey, a former Major League Baseball player.  Garvey  entered  the race in October, following months of rumors about his possible candidacy. Garvey often polled below Schiff and close to Porter, according to  FiveThirtyEight data . Some news reports before the election  characterized the race  as one for  second place  between Porter and Garvey. In February, Schiff’s campaign released a television ad contrasting him with Garvey. This tactic was expected to  accomplish  two  goals  for Schiff: to burnish his image for Democrats, and to make Republican voters aware of Garvey, potentially vaulting him above Porter and making the general election contest easier for Schiff in the solidly blue state.  Outside money played a role, too. A pro-Schiff political action committee  bankrolled a 30-second ad  in February that criticized Garvey for his conservative views and noted his past support for Trump. Around the same time these ads appeared, polling showed Garvey’s support increasing. Polling showed that after the ads aimed at boosting Garvey began airing, Porter saw a modest increase in support. In her post-election comments, however, Porter highlighted a different example of outside spending.  Fairshake, a political action committee linked to  cryptocurrency industry leaders , paid for the campaign ad Porter  called  ""dishonest"" and that she alleged ""rigged"" the election against her. In the 2024 election cycle so far, Fairshake has  spent $11.2 million  on federal elections, with about $10 million of that spent  opposing Porter , according to data from Open Secrets, a nonpartisan research group that tracks federal money in politics.  Fairshake’s ad claimed Porter accepted donations ""from Big Pharma, Big Oil and the Big Bank executives"" — a claim  The Sacramento Bee  fact-checked and rated ""mostly false,"" describing it as ""misleading to viewers.""  Spending such as this is legal under the 2010 Supreme Court decision,  Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission . ""That’s a fact, whether we like it or not,"" said Daniel Weiner, director of the Elections and Government Program at New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, a group that advocates for expanding voting rights. Billionaires spending unlimited amounts of money on ads opposing Porter would not be considered ""illegal acts designed to change the outcome of the election,"" he said. Political action committees cannot be financed by prohibited sources such as foreign groups and cannot coordinate with campaigns, Weiner said. He characterized the Federal Election Commission’s rules for what constitutes coordination as ""pretty weak."" Other political experts said that what occurred fell well short of rigging. They agreed that Porter’s failure to secure one of the top two spots owes more to Schiff’s yearslong cultivation of California voters and Porter’s political shortcomings than rigging.  ""If a well-endorsed established politician beats a relative newcomer, that’s politics,"" said Robin Kolodny, a Temple University political scientist. In American politics, experts say, money is a necessary component of a winning campaign but it is not the only one. In 2022,  eight of the 10 congressional candidates with the most self-funding  lost. In California, it is not uncommon  to see   well-financed   candidates   lose . Voters cast their ballot on Super Tuesday, at the Ranchito Elementary School polling station March 5, 2024, in Los Angeles’ Panorama City section. (AP) Experts said Porter’s use of ""rigged"" echoes rhetoric she’s used against financial institutions during her political career. ""Populist candidates and activists are especially prone to blaming the system, because it maintains their belief that the system needs radical change for justice and social justice to prevail,"" said Wayne Steger, a DePaul University political scientist. Democrats, including Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Alex Padilla of California, a former California secretary of state,  criticized  Porter’s use of the term ""rigged."" Steve Schale, a longtime Democratic strategist based in Florida, also  rebutted Porter’s statement  in an X post. Schale told PolitiFact he believes it’s unhealthy rhetoric. ""All you are doing is playing into the narrative that nobody actually loses,"" Schale said. ""One thing that makes our democracy work is people acknowledge they lose elections. There is nothing more important to our democracy than people acknowledging they lose elections."" Michael Thorning, structural democracy director at the Bipartisan Policy Center, agreed with Schale, calling Porter’s comment that billionaires spent money to rig the election ""completely irresponsible and unserious"" in a March 7  X post .  The Brennan Center’s Weiner said Porter was calling attention to a ""very real structural problem"" that can disadvantage voters and candidates with less money. But he said he would not have used the term ""rig"" to discuss the issue because in the current political environment false claims about election rigging are ""designed to delegitimize our democratic institutions.""  Porter said billionaires ""rigged"" the California senate primary election through ""dishonest means,"" citing outside funding that supported attack ads against her.  Outside funding for ads is legal and is not equivalent to predetermining a particular result. Rigging typically refers to things such as vote buying, ballot box stuffing or tampering with voting machines. It is based on limiting voter choice, and in the California race voters were free to choose among the candidates as they saw fit.

Official results take days to weeks to certify, experts said.       Media organizations can call races before every vote is counted.      There are several examples of presidential and state elections that took longer than the 2020 presidential election to call.      Learn more about PolitiFact’s  fact-checking process and rating system.","How long does it typically take to count all the votes in a presidential election? According to social media influencer Andrew Tate, the answer is less than 24 hours. Tate, who is on  trial for human trafficking , was featured in a recent Instagram video, talking about the 2020 election.  ""Never in the history of an election in America has the results taken more than 24 hours to count,"" Tate said in the March 8  post . ""Never in history. Here we are seven days later, they’re not finished.""  This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.)  The Instagram clip of Tate comes from a  Nov. 21, 2020, podcast  on Romanian fitness influencer Andy Popescu’s YouTube channel.  The 2020 election did not represent the first time presidential election vote counting took longer than 24 hours. In fact, experts said, it has always taken more than 24 hours to count presidential election ballots. Perhaps the most memorable example: The  2000 presidential election  between then-Vice President Al Gore and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, which was decided more than a month after Election Day when the Supreme Court stopped a manual recount and declared Bush the winner.  ""The United States has never counted all the ballots in a federal general election in 24 hours,"" David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit that promotes trust in election security, told PolitiFact. ""Every single state takes days or even weeks to certify official counts, by design, to ensure that the counts are final and accurate.""  The U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that provides information on election administration, says on its  website  that the results reported on election night ""are never the final, certified results.""  Media organizations often call the election winners before the official count is over based on  early ballots and data on demographics and voting history .  ""Election night ‘winners’ are those that the media has projected will win based on the margin of victory of votes already counted versus the volume of bills outstanding,"" Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer of programs at the National Association of Election Officials, told PolitiFact. ""There are always ballots still being processed — that is why EVERY state has their official canvass days, even weeks later.""  In the 2016 presidential election,  The Associated Press  called Trump the winner at 2:29 a.m. EST on Nov. 9, before the organization finished calling every state, based on Trump winning the necessary number of electoral votes. Congress met nearly two months later, on  Jan. 6, 2017 , to officially certify the election. ""That’s to ensure the counts are complete and verified,"" Becker said.  In 2020, it took  four days  to tally enough ballots for media outlets to call the election. That election took longer than the previous presidential election to call because pandemic restrictions led to a historic  amount of mail and early ballots , which take longer to count than in-person Election Day votes.  The counting process for mail ballots is not uniform across states. Fifteen states, including Maine, Minnesota and Virginia, do not allow absentee votes to be counted until after the polls close,  according to  the National Conference of State Legislatures. Michigan and Wisconsin did not allow mail ballots to be counted before Election Day 2020, Becker said. That is why the graphs in the Instagram clip show that Biden  overtook Trump’s lead  after the polls closed.  More recent state elections have taken even longer to call. For example,  Minnesota’s 2008 U.S. Senate race  was declared eight months after Election Day, and a 2010 Alaska  U.S. Senate race  was called after two weeks.  We rate the claim that the 2020 election was the only time in American history that an election took more than 24 hours to count False.",false,Instagram posts,2024-03-08,2024-03-14,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Detroit_vote_counting_2020_AP/b64c6ff0816bf3e9650e81952a1e97fb.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/mar/14/instagram-posts/it-takes-longer-than-24-hours-to-count-votes/,"Elections, Facebook Fact-checks, Instagram posts"
politifact,Valid IDs are not required for voting.,"In 36 states, voters are required or requested to present some form of identification at the polls. Some state laws are stricter, requiring photo IDs; other states are laxer, accepting bank statements or utility bills as proof of identity.     Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., require no identification to vote at the polls. These states use other methods, such as signature matching, to verify voters’ identities.

A March 9  Facebook post  shared a list of 65 activities that require ""valid IDs,"" including driving a car, buying alcohol or cigarettes, boarding a plane and applying for a job. The only thing that doesn’t require a valid ID, the post says, is ""voting."" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) (Screengrab from Facebook) Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate until this month, in 2022 shared a similar claim that voter ID was not required; we rated that  Mostly False . Has much changed since then? Not really. Voter ID laws vary across the country, but in most states, voters must verify their identity in some way at the polls. The  National Conference of State Legislatures  said 36 states have laws that require or request some form of identification to vote in person. Those laws applied to about 62% of registered voters in the 2022 election, according to U.S. Census Bureau  data . The laws in these 36 states vary as to whether they are strictly applied and whether a photo ID or another form of identification is accepted. Ten states — Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin — have what the conference labels as ""strict"" photo ID laws. This means that voters who lack acceptable photo IDs must vote a provisional ballot and take additional steps to verify their identity after Election Day for their ballot to be counted. Three states — Arizona, North Dakota and Wyoming — have ""strict"" ID laws, according to the conference, but photo ID is not the only identification accepted. In Arizona, for example, a recent utility bill or bank statement are acceptable forms of ID. In 23 states, the voter ID laws are what the conference considers ""nonstrict,"" meaning in most cases, voters without acceptable identification can cast a regular ballot without having to take further action after Election Day. For instance, a voter without proper identification may sign an affidavit or poll workers may vouch for a voter’s identity. Eleven of these ""nonstrict"" states accept only photo IDs; the other 12 states accept photo IDs and other forms of identification. The remaining 14 states and Washington, D.C., do not require any form of identification to vote at the polls, NCSL said. These states and Washington, D.C., which together accounted for about 38% of registered voters in 2022,  use other methods to verify voters’ identities , such as matching voters’ signatures or asking voters for personal information. Federal law  requires  first-time voters who register to vote by mail and didn’t provide proof of identification at the time of registration, to show a valid photo ID or another form of ID, such as a current paycheck, bank statement or government document that shows the voter’s name and address, the conference said. States have different laws and procedures for verifying the identity of voters who cast mail ballots. In 22 states, voters applying for a mail ballot must show ID, provide an ID number, such as from a driver’s license or Social Security card, or obtain a witness or notary signature, according to the  Voting Rights Lab , an organization that tracks state election laws and proposed legislation. In 21 other states, the Voting Rights Lab said, voters requesting mail ballots must verify their identity using personal information, such as date of birth, address or signature. The remaining seven states and Washington, D.C., have universal mail voting, so ballots are automatically sent to voters ahead of every election, without voters needing to request them, the Voting Rights Lab said. Election officials in every state  use signature verification  to validate the identities of voters who cast mail ballots, the National Vote at Home Institute said. After the 2020 election, many Republican lawmakers sympathetic to former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud have  pushed for tighter voter ID requirements  to combat fraud, which national experts have said is  isolated and rare.  Democrats and voting rights advocates have criticized some state voter ID laws, particularly ones with narrow lists of acceptable types of ID, as overly burdensome. A Facebook post claimed that valid IDs are not required to vote in U.S. elections. But there isn’t a total absence of voter ID laws in the U.S. In 36 states, voters are required or requested to present some form of ID to cast a ballot in person. These laws applied to about 6 in 10 voters in the 2022 elections. The remaining 14 states and Washington, D.C., use other methods to verify voters’ identities. Federal law requires first-time voters to present valid ID when requesting mail ballots, and almost half the states have additional ID requirements for voters applying for mail ballots.

Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy.  Learn more .","Recently ousted Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel faced tough questions on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" over her support for former President Donald Trump’s evidence-free statements about a ""rigged"" 2020 election. McDaniel appeared March 24 on ""Meet the Press,"" just two days after NBC hired her as a paid commentator on its news programs. The  decision to hire  McDaniel prompted a backlash from prominent voices inside NBC News, including former ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd. They argued that McDaniel’s support for Trump’s claims raised questions about her credibility as a commentator. In the ""Meet the Press"" interview, McDaniel walked a tightrope, distancing herself from Trump’s most incendiary  false   rhetoric  about the election and calling Joe Biden ""the legitimate president,"" while still asserting that there were legitimate ""concerns"" about the 2020 election. She said the Republican National Committee, now run by Michael Whatley and Trump daughter-in-law Lara Trump following McDaniel’s ouster, is involved with 78  ""election integrity"" lawsuits .  ""I'll give you one example. One's in Montana right now with Democrats suing to say, ‘You should be allowed to be registered to vote in two states,’"" McDaniel said. ""Why are they suing on that?"" This doesn’t give the full story. Two liberal-leaning Montana-based groups have sued in federal court to block a law that establishes a criminal penalty for being registered to vote in more than one state. The groups argue that, under the law, people who move to Montana and fail to deregister to vote in their former state could face criminal liability, even though they don’t intend to vote in both places. Double voting is already illegal under existing Montana law. Montana, which has a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled Legislature, is defending the law. The lawsuit is pending, with the RNC granted the right to help argue the state’s position. McDaniel did not answer inquiries for this article placed with the Republican National Committee and NBC. The law in question,  HB 892 , passed both legislative chambers with unanimous Republican support and some backing from Democratic legislators. Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, signed the bill in May 2023. The law says that people may not ""purposefully remain registered"" to vote in more than one place in Montana or another state. A violation carries a fine up to $5,000 and/or up to 18 months in prison. The Montana Public Interest Research Group, which works to register voters on college campuses, and the Montana Federation of Public Employees, a public employee union, sued in September 2023 to block the law. The lawsuit argues that the phrase ""purposefully remain registered"" is vague when referring to voters who don’t intend to vote in more than one jurisdiction. It says the criminal penalties ""have the effect of deterring potential Montana voters from registering."" The complaint argued that new college students in the state are particularly at risk because many of them had already registered in their home states before moving to Montana. ""The ambiguities of what they need to do to comply with H.B. 892 and avoid potentially severe criminal penalties will chill them from registering and voting in Montana,"" the complaint argues. The state is defending the law in federal court. In a response filed with the court, the state said the plaintiffs ""ignore the obvious fact that a registrant easily complies with H.B. 892 by simply providing their prior registration information. … If the resident provides the information, there is no reasonable risk of violation."" The response added that ""a person of ordinary intelligence can easily understand what is required of them in this context.""  Oral arguments  were held  a few days before McDaniel’s ""Meet the Press"" interview. Rachel Orey, senior associate director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said McDaniel’s statement ""incorrectly implies that plaintiffs are trying to give Montana voters an ability to register in two states that voters elsewhere lack.""  ""What matters to election outcomes is not whether individuals are registered twice, but whether they vote twice,"" Orey said. Orey acknowledged that it’s ""not ideal to have voters registered in multiple states, as it results in wasted election office resources and can hurt voter confidence if a voter receives election mail for an individual who has since moved from that address.""  However, standard list maintenance procedures and state-to-state collaboration can address the pitfalls of multiple registrations for a voter, Orey said, without resorting to ""overly restrictive"" laws that increase the risk of voters being disenfranchised. In Montana, election officials take steps to maintain the accuracy of voter rolls. Montana’s voter registration form asks applicants to provide previous registration information in another county or state. The Montana secretary of state’s office then sends a notice to the secretary of state’s office in the former state, said Bradley Seaman, Missoula County’s elections administrator. Montana election officials also receive similar notifications from other states, Seaman said. Being on the voter rolls in two states is not unusual nationwide. Media outlets in 2017 found several  instances  of  Trump advisers ,  Trump administration  members and  family   members  who remained on the voter rolls in two states. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in California who served as the Biden administration’s first senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights, said double voting happens, but is ""exceedingly rare."" ""People who happen to be registered in more than one place are usually on the rolls in two places just because they haven’t bothered to remove their old registration (and the old state hasn’t gotten around to it yet), not because they plan to use both registrations to vote,"" Levitt said. There’s also a paper trail, which makes the federal crime of double voting ""straightforward to prosecute,""said Levitt. The  Electronic Registration Information Center  was designed to help states screen for people registered in more than one state. The consortium, which includes about half the states, allows intrastate sharing of voter registration data. Montana is not a member. McDaniel said Montana Democrats are ""suing to say, ‘You should be allowed to be registered to vote in two states.’"" McDaniel misrepresented the lawsuit. Two Montana-based groups filed a lawsuit that seeks to block a 2023 state law, arguing that it makes failing to deregister to vote after a move from out of state a crime, even if the voter doesn’t intend to cast a ballot in both places.  McDaniel’s statement has an element of truth, in that overturning the law would mean people would not be prosecuted for simply being registered in two states. But McDaniel’s claim gives listeners the wrong impression, because the plaintiffs are not seeking an affirmative right for Montana voters to register to vote in a second state. Instead, they want to protect voters who unintentionally failed to cancel their registration in their previous state of residence from being charged with a crime.  We rate her claim Mostly False.

politifact,"“When it comes to how many votes (President) Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward.”","Godlewski was referring to all wards in the state of Wisconsin, not a specific city or county.     Taking President Joe Biden’s vote margin and dividing it by the total number of wards does result in about three voters per ward.     Godlewski is taking wards together as an average, and different parts of the state would have delivered more or less votes for Biden.","At a  rally in suburban Waukesha earlier this month , first lady Jill Biden and other Democratic officials laid out what’s at stake in the 2024 election, focusing on abortion and health care access. Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski was one of the speakers who took the stage before the first lady, asking a crowd of mostly women voters to talk to their neighbors and help get out the vote. ""When it comes to how many votes (President) Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward,"" Godlewski said.   We often mention that Biden won Wisconsin in 2020 by  a little more than 20,000 votes . But taking a look at the votes by ward could give an interesting picture of how competitive the election was – and could be again this fall. And other Democrats seem to be repeating the same message, including when Biden visited his new campaign headquarters in Milwaukee.  ""In Wisconsin, every election comes down to three to four votes per ward,"" the state party’s Deputy Organizing Director Jaliah Jefferson said at that event. As the state heads for a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, let’s look at how many votes it came down to by ward last time. When we asked for backup, Nathan Schwantes, Godlewski’s chief of staff, said the secretary of state was talking about the entire state of Wisconsin, not a specific city or county. He explained that Biden won the state by 20,682 votes (which is correct) and that Wisconsin had 6,656 wards where voters lived.  That division results in 3.1 votes per ward.  He added that there’s a slightly different count of wards in Wisconsin, which includes wards where no voters live. That number was 7,078, giving a result of 2.9 voters. State law says  that wards are the ""building blocks"" for creating districts for local, state and federal offices. And ""all territory, even if unpopulated, must be contained in a ward."" That explains why some wards might not actually have voters in them.  Schwantes shared an email from the nonpartisan Legislative Technology Services Bureau, which confirms the 7,078 number. That total was from July, because the next count was not taken until January.  Whichever total ward number is used, the calculations result in around a few votes per ward.  So, Godlewski’s math is correct. Wards vary widely in population. And blue areas of the state would have delivered many more votes for Biden per ward, and red areas would have delivered much less.  For example, Biden lost Waukesha County to Trump — where Godlewski made the claim — by 55,743 votes.  Looking at the  ward-by-ward report of 2020 presidential results , Waukesha County had about 387 wards, so that comes down to about 144 votes per ward that Biden lost by. The similar claim, from Jefferson, simply said that elections in Wisconsin come down to a few votes per ward — not that Biden specifically won or lost those few votes everywhere. For comparison, in Milwaukee County — where Jefferson made her claim — Biden won over Trump by 183,045 votes.  Milwaukee County had about 572 wards, coming down to about 320 votes per ward that Biden won by. Counties use ""reporting units""  to report results , which can be one ward or a group of wards.  So, our analysis of those counties is an estimate and includes wards where no voters live — there are many like that in the City of Waukesha. Biden certainly didn’t win — or lose — by three votes per ward in every county, but it is the right average.  It’s clear that Godlewski was speaking generally about the entire state. And presidents are elected based on how many electoral votes the entire state has, not by counties or wards.  At a Waukesha rally, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski said ""when it comes to how many votes Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward."" Although ""less than a few"" is open to interpretation, 2.9 or 3.1 is certainly a small number, considering that several hundred voters can live in one ward.  And although her claim doesn’t require a caveat because presidents are elected statewide, we should still note that Biden’s vote-per-ward margin would have been larger or smaller in certain areas of the state.   We rate her claim True.   ",true,Sarah Godlewski,2024-03-03,2024-03-28,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Milwaukee_voters_in_line_MJS/f70dfe9a60877e5094b75f37d3d78cbc.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/mar/28/sarah-godlewski/did-the-2020-presidential-election-in-wisconsin-re/,"National, Elections, Wisconsin, Sarah Godlewski"

politifact,"In 2020, Trump “did much better” in the Wisconsin election than 2016, and “after the wrongdoing was found, people said, ‘Well, he actually did win.’”","Former President Donald Trump claimed he performed better in 2020 than 2016 in Wisconsin. He won the state in 2016 but lost in 2020.      Recounts and reviews upheld Biden’s victory and found there was no widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.      PolitiFact Wisconsin has debunked these claims before, and we’ll continue doing so as Trump repeats them in this cycle.","Former President Donald Trump repeated familiar false claims ahead of his first visit to Wisconsin this campaign cycle: that he actually won the state in 2020 and there was widespread voter fraud. On April 1, 2024 — a day before  Wisconsin’s presidential primary  and Trump’s first 2024 rally in the state — Trump appeared on WISN-AM’s Dan O’Donnell show.  Trump incorrectly said he won Wisconsin in 2020. He did win the state in 2016, but lost in 2020. ""We had a reelection the second time. We actually did much better than the first time. We won in Wisconsin, as you know, the first time. The second time we did much better,"" Trump said. Trump also falsely claimed that he won after ""wrongdoing"" was discovered in the 2020 election. ""But I guess it was delayed,"" Trump continued. ""They found out a lot of wrongdoing. And after the wrongdoing was found, people said, ‘Well, he actually did win.’"" O’Donnell, a conservative talk radio host, did not push back on Trump’s false claims that he won the state in 2020 or that there was wrongdoing in the presidential election.  PolitiFact Wisconsin has checked these claims before. But ahead of Trump’s  rally in Green Bay  let’s take a trip down memory lane. Trump did not win Wisconsin in 2020, though he did win the state in 2016 Let’s tackle the first part of Trump’s claim: That he performed better in Wisconsin in 2020 than he did in 2016.  That is unequivocally false. And it’s something PolitiFact Wisconsin has  checked  on multiple occasions, including in 2021.  We noted then, and we’ll repeat here, that President Joe Biden won Wisconsin in 2020. Biden took 1,630,866  votes  compared to Trump’s 1,610,184 in the state, so Trump lost by 20,682 votes.  Trump did win the state in 2016, taking more than 22,000  votes  over Democrat Hillary Clinton. He  netted  1,405,284 votes in Wisconsin in 2016. So, although Trump picked up more raw votes in 2020, his performance was not better because he ultimately lost by about 20,000 votes. PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Trump’s campaign for backup but did not hear back by deadline. Bottom line: Trump did not win Wisconsin in 2020. PolitiFact Wisconsin has repeatedly  rated that claim  Pants on Fire.  Recounts affirmed Biden’s victory, no widespread fraud or wrongdoing In the second part of Trump’s claim, he says that he won after ""a lot of wrongdoing"" was discovered.  Let’s look back again. In 2020, PolitiFact Wisconsin  explained  that recounts Trump requested upheld Biden’s victory.  The net pickup for Biden was 74 votes in the heavily Democratic Milwaukee and Dane counties. So, Trump actually fell further behind. So, again, recounts affirmed that Biden won the election.  PolitiFact Wisconsin has also debunked several claims that there was ""wrongdoing"" or pervasive voter fraud.  That includes clarifying that late returns for Biden were because of how  Milwaukee counts its absentee ballots , not fraud.  We’ve also  debunked his claim  that absentee ballots were being dumped in rivers or creeks.  On top of that, a probe led by former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman — who has aligned with Trump and promoted his false claims —  turned up no evidence  the election was incorrectly called. The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty also  found no evidence  of widespread fraud. State auditors  also found  voting machines worked properly.  We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Even reviews led by conservatives found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  PolitiFact Wisconsin found false Trump’s claims of pervasive ""wrongdoing"" many times before, and the same applies here. In a radio interview, Trump repeated familiar false refrains. That is, that he won Wisconsin in 2020 and ""after the wrongdoing was found, people said, ‘Well, he actually did win.’""  Biden won the state in 2020. Recounts actually expanded Biden’s margin, and multiple reviews — including by conservatives — found there was no widespread voter fraud. PolitiFact Wisconsin has checked these claims before, and we’ll continue doing so if Trump airs them as he hits the ground in Wisconsin ahead of November.  We’ve given a Pants on Fire rating for similar Trump claims in the past, and we do the same again here.",pants-fire,Donald Trump,2024-04-01,2024-04-01,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Trump_Green_Bay/b3a86675819cdb21658b93455ad72d7f.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/apr/01/donald-trump/ahead-of-first-2024-rally-in-wisconsin-trump-repea/,"Elections, Wisconsin, Donald Trump"
politifact,You can vote in-person absentee at your clerk’s office on Monday before Election Day.,"Early voting was no longer possible on April 1, when Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., made his tweet.      State law allows for early voting between 14 days before the election and the Sunday before Election Day, leaving Monday out.     Voters can still go to the polls in person April 2 and register to vote there.","In a change of tune from previous elections, Republicans have encouraged voters to ""bank"" their votes by casting their votes early at in-person absentee sites. That includes Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who represents western Wisconsin in Congress. On April 1, 2024, he  wrote  on X (formerly Twitter): ""Get out and vote in-person-absentee TODAY at your clerks office! (Or) in-person tomorrow at your designated polling station!"" Van Orden said. But for Wisconsin’s presidential primary election — held April 2 — early voting was offered only through March 31.  Let’s clear up the dates for early voting in Wisconsin, and why that wasn’t an option at the time Van Orden made the claim. For presidential primary, clerks could offer early voting from March 19 to March 31 Van Orden’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Wisconsin Elections Commission has a  list of dates  for the presidential primary, including the deadline for early voting.  That list explains that early voting started on March 19, and can run through March 31. March 31 was Easter and marked the Sunday before Election Day. Communities can choose which dates in that range to have early voting, along with hours and locations. While it can take place at a clerk’s office, it can also be held at community centers and libraries, for example. For example, the  city of Milwaukee  offered early voting through March 30 and included locations such as the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Helene Zelazo Center for the Performing Arts.  The restriction on conducting early voting on Monday isn’t just for this election. It’s part of state law.  ""If application is made in person, the application shall be made no earlier than 14 days preceding the election and no later than the Sunday preceding the election,""  state law says .  Translation: In-person absentee can happen only between 14 days out from the election and the Sunday before Election Day (which is always a Tuesday). So, that means early voting is impossible Monday, which is when Van Orden made his tweet encouraging people to do so.  And one more interesting point: Wisconsin does not allow for  voter registration  on the Saturday, Sunday or Monday before Election Day.  So, early voting toward the end of that time range is not possible if you need to register or re-register. If that applies to you, registering at the polls is still an option.  Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. April 2. That second part of Van Orden’s claim is right: You can vote in-person at the polls tomorrow. The day before Wisconsin’s presidential primary, U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., encouraged people to ""get out and vote in-person-absentee TODAY at your clerks office!"" But state law allows for early voting only through the Sunday before an Election Day. Early voting was not offered on the Monday before the election, when Van Orden made his claim. One more reminder for good measure: You can still go to your polling place April 2, and register to vote there if you need to.  But Van Orden gave voters the impression they could vote in-person absentee April 1, when in fact that opportunity ended on March 31.  We rate his claim False.    ",false,Derrick Van Orden,2024-04-01,2024-04-01,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/MJS_EARLYVOTING_2_HOFFMAN_74229231/fe8141cb6c20ea72951e8db0e09fa410.JPG,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/apr/01/derrick-van-orden/no-you-cannot-vote-in-person-absentee-the-day-befo/,"Elections, Wisconsin, Derrick Van Orden"

Voter registrations of people on the list who failed to provide proof of citizenship would be canceled, the statement said.  A previous PolitiFact  article  found that the list of 95,000 names was created by cross-referencing people registered to vote with the names of people who said they were not citizens when they got a driver’s license or state identification card.  In 2019 alone, 97,675 people became citizens in Texas, Department of Homeland Security  data  found. That means people on the list could have become naturalized after receiving their driver’s licenses.  Days after Whitley issued the advisory, his office said that  25,000  of the names on the list were mistakenly added.  In a February 2019  letter  to lawmakers obtained by  The Texas Tribune , Whitley apologized for errors in the list, writing, ""In hindsight, however, before announcing the number of people who may not be eligible to vote, more time should have been devoted to additional communication with the counties and DPS (Department of Public Safety) to further eliminate anyone from our original list who is, in fact, eligible to vote.""   The incident led the Texas Senate to not confirm Whitley as secretary of state by the end of its 2019 legislative session;  he resigned  just before the session’s end.

politifact,"“We’ve had 12 elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes.”","As of 2024, Wisconsin has had a dozen close-call races in the last two decades.     Those include presidential, attorney general, gubernatorial and state Supreme Court races.","Wisconsin is used to tight elections. Razor-thin presidential races. Statewide cliffhangers. But when Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming claimed in a media call during Vice President Kamala Harris’ March 6 visit that ""We’ve had 12 elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes,"" it struck us as a lot. So, we decided to dig into the numbers. When PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted state GOP spokesman Matt Fisher to determine which races Schimming was referring to, he supplied a list of 12. PolitiFact confirmed the results from those races with the Wisconsin Elections Commission  election results archive  and added the vote margin. This is how the races played out in the last 24 years: 2000 presidential – Republican candidate George W. Bush narrowly defeated Vice President Al Gore by 5,708 votes. 2004 presidential – Bush won again, beating out Democratic ticket of then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry by 11,384 votes. 2006 attorney general – Republican J.B. Van Hollen defeated then-Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk by 8,859 votes. 2008 Wisconsin Supreme Court – Conservative Michael J. Gableman secured victory against incumbent Justice Louis Butler with a 22,303 vote margin. 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court – The incumbent justice, conservative David Prosser Jr., won a second 10-year term after defeating assistant Wisconsin Attorney General JoAnne Kloppenburg by 7,004 votes. 2016 presidential – Republican Donald Trump beat out former secretary of state and first lady of the United States Hillary Clinton by 22,784 votes. 2018 gubernatorial – Incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker lost his run for a third term after being defeated by Democratic challenger and then-Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers. Evers won with a 29,227 vote margin. 2018 attorney general race – Current Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, defeated Republican incumbent Brad Schimel by 17,190 votes. 2019 Wisconsin Supreme Court – Former Appeals Judge Brian Hagedorn defeated then-Appeals Chief Judge Lisa Neubauer with a 5,981 vote gap. 2020 presidential – The race saw current President and then-former Vice President Joe Biden beat incumbent Republican President, Donald Trump by 20,608 votes. 2022 U.S. Senate – Incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson won his re-election to a third term after defeating Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes by 26,718 votes. 2022 secretary of state – Incumbent Democrat Doug La Follette narrowly beat out Republican state legislator Amy Loudenbeck. He won a 12th term in office with a 7,442 vote margin. It’s worth noting that only two presidential contests in the last 24 years did not have close calls: 2008 and 2012. In those two election years, former President Barack Obama won by 414,818 and 213,019 votes, respectively.

Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation, sued the Biden administration, arguing that the government sought to have tech companies suppress First Amendment-protected speech. Two states separately sued the administration over its communications with social media companies.     Presidents John Adams and Woodrow Wilson signed sedition laws that targeted critics of the federal government, prompting  some of those critics to be prosecuted and punished.      Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy.  Learn more.","Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused President Joe Biden of being a greater ""threat to democracy"" than former President Donald Trump, arguing that Biden censored him. ""President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech or to censor his opponent,"" Kennedy said in an  April 1 interview  on CNN.  Kennedy, who is running as an independent, referred to his lawsuit against the federal government in which he alleges the government censored his social media statements against vaccines. A judge granted Kennedy’s request for a preliminary injunction in the case, although it was stayed pending a ruling in another case. Biden, Kennedy said on CNN, ""started censoring — not just me — but 37 hours after he took the oath of office, he was censoring me. No president in the country has ever done that."" Kennedy then pivoted to a lawsuit two Republican-led states filed to challenge the federal government’s communications with social media companies. ""The greatest threat to democracy is not somebody who questions election returns, but a president of the United States who uses the power of his office to force the social media companies … to censor his political critics,"" he said. There are a few problems with Kennedy’s statement.  First, he wasn’t Biden’s political opponent in January 2021, when a Biden administration official noticed Kennedy posting an anti-vaccine conspiracy theory and contacted Twitter. Kennedy didn’t declare his presidential run until April 2023.  Second, history shows there have been other U.S. presidents who have taken far more extreme measures to silence political dissent.  Third, the court cases that Kennedy alluded to remain pending; Kennedy can continue to freely make statements about vaccines. Experts told PolitiFact that the Biden administration’s efforts to get social media platforms to moderate false posts is not the same as censoring opponents. We emailed the Kennedy campaign press team and received a response that our request for comment was under consideration. Kennedy wrote Jan. 22, 2021, on Twitter, that U.S. Baseball Hall of Famer  Hank Aaron died  as ""part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly"" following his COVID-19 vaccine.  Aaron , 86, died from unrelated natural causes, a medical examiner found. A Biden White House official  emailed Twitter  Jan. 23, 2021, and said, ""Wondering if we can get moving on the process for having it removed ASAP.""  At the time,  social media companies  including Twitter policies had developed policies to handle false or misleading claims about COVID-19.  Kennedy’s post wasn’t removed; it is still live today.  Instagram’s parent company disabled Kennedy’s personal Instagram account in  February 2021  for spreading false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, but restored it after he launched his presidential bid more than two years later. His  Instagram account  has nearly 2 million followers. Kennedy, along with his legal advocacy group Children’s Health Defense and a Louisiana resident  sued  the administration in 2023, arguing that the government worked to have tech companies suppress First Amendment-protected speech, including items that could make the public ""hesitant"" toward COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The lawsuit states that a Biden spokesperson accused Kennedy of ""producing 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation on social-media platforms."" The lawsuit is not only about COVID-19 posts or posts by Kennedy — it alleges that the government sought to suppress posts about the 2020 election and Hunter Biden’s laptop. The  lawsuit  says that ""efforts by federal officers to induce social-media platforms to censor speech appear to have begun in 2020,"" which would have been under Trump, and criticizes actions by the Biden administration, which started in January 2021.  Although Kennedy received a  preliminary injunction  in the case, that February ruling was stayed until the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a related case brought by Missouri and Louisiana. The states accuse the Biden administration of breaching the First Amendment by discussing content moderation with social media companies, suppressing conservatives’ content about COVID-19 and voting by mail. The  Justice Department argued , ""Social-media users have a First Amendment right to be free from governmental restrictions on their speech, but they have no First Amendment right to post content on private platforms that the platforms would prefer not to host.""  Sheri Berman, a political science professor at Barnard College at Columbia University, said Kennedy’s being among the people spreading false or dangerous information does not mean that the Biden administration ""was attacking him, as an individual citizen or as a potential opponent of Biden."" Berman said it’s reasonable for citizens and candidates to debate how much social media moderation should exist.  ""However, general attempts to limit the spread of dangerous or false information about extremely sensitive and consequential topics — like elections results or the efficacy of vaccines during a pandemic — is not a threat to democracy,"" Berman said. Thomas Healy, a law professor at Seton Hall Law School, said the Supreme Court will ultimately resolve the question of whether the Biden administration engaged in censorship. ""The federal government is entitled to use the bully pulpit to advance its policy goals, and most modern administrations have done so,"" Healy said. ""Such communications would rise to the level of censorship only if the encouragement crossed the line into coercion, and that is a factual question."" Two lower courts ruled that the government likely did engage in coercion, but a majority of the Supreme Court  seemed   skeptical  of that claim during March oral arguments. ""Even if the Supreme Court agrees with the lower courts that the Biden administration violated the First Amendment, its actions are a far cry from the punishment of political opponents we have seen at earlier moments in American history and that Donald Trump has promised to pursue if reelected,"" Healy said. Whatever happens with the current court cases, history is clear about one thing: Past U.S. administrations have imposed far more extreme policies in response to government criticism. Four examples: President John Adams  in 1798 signed the  Sedition Act , which permitted the deportation, fine or imprisonment of anyone deemed a threat or who published ""false, scandalous, or malicious writing"" against the U.S. government.  Many newspaper editors who criticized Adams’ administration were prosecuted. The unpopular law contributed to Adams’ presidential election defeat in 1800, and the law expired.  Steven Levitsky, a government professor at Harvard University, called Kennedy’s comparison baseless and ""reckless."" ""In Adams' time,"" he said, ""newspapers were virtually the ONLY form of expression.""  President Woodrow Wilson  signed the  Sedition Act of 1918 , which made it a crime to write or publish ""any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language"" about the government or the war effort. Wilson’s Justice Department brought about 2,000 indictments under the Espionage and Sedition Acts of 1917 and 1918, Healy, the Seton Hall law professor, said. One of the people jailed under the acts was Eugene Debs, the Socialist Party leader who ran for president against Wilson in 1912. Debs was arrested in 1918 after giving an antiwar speech and  convicted  of violating the Espionage Act of 1917. He ran for president in 1920 under the Socialist Party banner from a federal prison in Alabama and his prison sentence was later commuted.  In 1917, Wilson issued  an executive order  creating the Records of the Committee on Public Information, which was a ""a vast effort in propaganda,"" Boston University journalism professor Christopher Daly  wrote . The Justice Department in the late 1940s and 1950s  under Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower prosecuted the Communist Party of America’s leaders under the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate for the U.S. government’s overthrow by violence or force, Healy said. ""The evidence against them showed that they were mainly teaching the doctrines of Marx and Lenin; there was no evidence that they were taking concrete steps to initiate a violent overthrow,"" Healy said. President Abraham Lincoln  in May 1864 issued an  executive order  commanding Union Army Maj. Gen. John A. Dix to ""arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command the editors, proprietors, and publishers"" of newspapers that printed a forged presidential proclamation calling for the drafting of 400,000 more troops. News accounts at the time said newspaper offices were seized and at least one proprietor was arrested. Kennedy said ""President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history, that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech ... to censor his opponent."" There are several factual issues with the claim. Kennedy was referring to a Biden administration official emailing Twitter in January 2021, asking the platform to remove Kennedy’s false post about the COVID-19 vaccine causing Hank Aaron’s death.  Kennedy didn’t announce his presidential candidacy for more than two years after that post, which remains live on Twitter. Kennedy has sued the administration over its communications with social media companies. And courts are weighing whether these communications amount to censorship. But even if someone deems the Biden administration’s actions censorship, Kennedy is wrong about history. Presidents Adams and Wilson signed sedition legislation that made it a crime to criticize the federal government. Those laws led to the prosecution of political figures, including Debs, who ran for president. Their actions also targeted the free press.

(Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We saw similar statements on  X ,  TikTok  and  Facebook . On  Truth Social , former President Donald Trump asked who are the millions of voters registering without photo ID. The figures in the social posts represent  the number of times  states have verified voters’ Social Security numbers. This process is done with the Help America Vote Verification (HAVV). HAVV is a  system  established in 2004 in which states can verify a voter’s identification with the Social Security Administration.  State or local election officials in the three states — including Republicans — said the figures do not accurately reflect the number of voters’ who registered without photo ID. All of the election officials said they take steps to ensure that only eligible citizens cast ballots and had no evidence of widespread voter registration by noncitizens. ""The data does not represent the numbers of newly registered voters, and any representation they do is false,"" Ellen Lyon, a spokesperson at Pennsylvania’s Department of State, told PolitiFact.  We told the End Wokeness social media user that voting officials from the three states said the data was misrepresented in the social post. The account’s author responded by saying ""it is deeply concerning that ANYONE is registering to vote without a photo ID"" and criticized mail-in voting. Texas and Arizona require a photo ID to vote, but Pennsylvania does not. The Social Security Administration’s press office did not immediately respond to our questions about the data.  States also use the system to verify new voters who do not use a photo ID when registering to vote. As a result, the same voter’s Social Security number could be verified multiple times in one year. For example, in Pennsylvania, according to the Department of State, there have been only 75,000 new voter registrations, making it impossible that 580,513 voters registered without photo ID as the claim asserts. ""In Pennsylvania, the Department of State uses the Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) to check partial social security numbers (SSN) not only for voter registration applications, but also for absentee and mail ballot applications,"" Lyon said.  The Social Security Administration’s data represents the raw number of times a state checks a voter’s social security verification. The database also does not show the number of noncitizens who registered this year without a photo ID. Nor does it verify their citizenship status.  In Texas, only 57,711 new voters have registered this year, according to Secretary of State Jane Nelson, a former Republican state senator.  Her office released a  statement  earlier this month calling the 1.2 million figure in social media posts ""clearly incorrect.""  ""When Texans register to vote they must provide a driver license number or a Social Security number. When an individual registers to vote with just a SSN, the state verifies that the SSN is authentic,"" the statement explained. Arizona has taken similar steps to counter the inaccurate social media claims. Stephen Richer, Arizona’s Republican Maricopa County Recorder,  replied  to Musk’s post on X, explaining how the claim is inaccurate.  ""There is 0 validity to the suggestion in the original post that 220,731 illegal immigrants have registered in Arizona in 2024,"" Richer wrote. Richer said that in Arizona there have been only about 60,000 new voter registrations this year and Social Security verifications are used to check proof of identity, not to check citizenship status. Screenshot from X JP Martin, a spokesperson for Arizona’s secretary of state, told PolitiFact that 90% of verification of citizenship proof is done through the Motor Vehicles Division in Arizona, not through the Social Security Administration. In an  Arizona voting case , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states are obligated to permit registration for federal elections using a federal form that does not require documentary proof of citizenship. That means that Arizona provides voters who lack proof with a ""federal only"" ballot. The state has about 35,000 people on the federal-only list out of the roughly  4 million  voters, Martin said.  That number is nearly eight times smaller than the amount of HAVV queries that were made to verify voter’s Social Security numbers.  An  article  by Votebeat Arizona found that the majority of federal-only voters in Arizona are college-age students who may not be able to easily access documents that prove their citizenship.  Amid a high number of border encounters this year, viral social media accounts and some politicians including Trump have continued to spread the long-standing  falsehood  of mass voting by noncitizens. Noncitizens occasionally cast ballots , but this is rare. Most noncitizens don’t want to risk jail time (or deportation if they are here illegally) by casting a ballot. Election officials take several steps to ensure that only eligible voters cast ballots.   An Instagram post claims that the Social Security Administration’s data proves that more than 2 million noncitizens registered to vote without photo ID in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Texas this year. But the data does not reflect the number of noncitizens who have registered to vote without a photo ID. The data shows the amount of times states have verified voters’ Social Security numbers. States can request to verify the same voter’s Social Security number multiple times.  State officials from Arizona, Pennsylvania and Texas said the numbers of people who registered to vote this year in their respective states are significantly smaller than the figures cited in the post.  We rate this claim False.  PolitiFact Senior Correspondent Amy Sherman contributed to this report. ",false,Instagram posts,2024-04-03,2024-04-05,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Voter_Registration_2024/1a10d53f5e0a6a1d2fcb89814afd3be5.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/apr/05/instagram-posts/more-than-2-million-noncitizens-have-not-registere/,"Immigration, Elections, Voter ID Laws, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Texas, Instagram posts"

politifact,"After a 2022 law, “the vast majority of colleges in New York State do not have on-campus poll sites.”","Two studies, one of them by Jonathan Becker's group, support the idea that a little under two-thirds of four-year New York State colleges lack a campus voting site.     The difficulty of obtaining information makes it unclear how many of the campuses studied would be covered by a 2022 law requiring campus voting sites.     Our mission: Help you be an informed participant in democracy.  Learn more .","Legislation enacted by New York state in 2022 requires most colleges and universities in the state to establish voting sites on or near campus. But a Bard College official who tracks the issue recently warned university presidents that little progress had been made on turning this mandate into reality. In a February open letter to New York state’s college presidents, Jonathan Becker, vice president for academic affairs at Bard College and director of the Hudson Valley college’s Center for Civic Engagement, urged colleges to create polling locations on or near campus if they don’t exist already. ""Unfortunately, as two recent studies show, state and local election administrators have not adequately prioritized or fully implemented this critical voter protection legislation,"" Becker wrote. ""The vast majority of colleges in New York state do not have on-campus poll sites and there has been almost no change since the passage of this legislation."" The two studies Becker cited show many college campuses in New York state lack voting sites. There’s statistical uncertainty about how many of these campuses would be covered by the law’s voting site requirements. Becker and other campus voting experts have long complained that boards of election, in New York state and elsewhere, have often imposed strict residency requirements and made voting sites inaccessible. Bard — along with the Andrew Goodman Foundation, a New York City-based voting rights group named for one of the three voter-registration volunteers murdered in Mississippi in 1964 — has been involved in the issue for years, filing lawsuits in 2020 and 2021  to bring a polling place to campus . ""I think a lot of students don't know that they can register to vote at their campus address,"" said Caroline Smith, the Andrew Goodman Foundation’s programs director. ""I think this is a major reason why students tend to vote absentee"" in their home state rather than where they attend school. The lawsuits  prompted the inclusion  of a provision in New York state’s 2023 budget that  required  colleges and universities with more than 300 registered voters on campus to have an on-campus polling location or one near the campus that was approved in coordination with the university. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the budgetary legislation that included the provision in April 2022. Becker told PolitiFact that both students and faculty members living on campus count toward the 300-voter threshold. The legislation also prevented campuses from being divided into multiple voting districts. Becker cited two studies showing that progress on applying the law has been incomplete.  One  study , published in February 2024 by Becker’s Center for Civic Engagement, found that almost half of New York’s 41 four-year public institutions with more than 1,000 students had regular or early voting sites. Twenty public universities had a polling location, and 21 did not.  Four-year public institutions with on-campus polling sites included Binghamton University, Brooklyn College, Stony Brook University and University at Albany. Those that did not included the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the University at Buffalo.  The rate of on-campus voting sites was lower for the 64 private institutions with more than 600 undergraduates, at 22%. Sixteen private universities had a polling location; 48 did not.  Private institutions with on-campus polling sites included Bard, Cornell University, New York University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Skidmore College, Syracuse University, Vassar College and Yeshiva University. Private institutions that did not have an on-campus site included Barnard College, Colgate University, Columbia College, Fordham University, Hamilton College, Hofstra University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Sarah Lawrence College, St. Bonaventure University, St. John’s University and the University of Rochester. A team from Rutgers Law School led by Yael Bromberg, a professor there, conducted the other study, which found a ""minor increase (2.2%) in the presence of on-campus poll sites between the 2018 and 2022 elections, when the law came into effect."" The study cautioned that some information was difficult to secure.  Many boards of elections ""do not have information on poll site locations on their websites, and those that do often do not indicate if the poll sites are on a college campus,"" the study said. ""Calls to boards of election often went unanswered. When interviewers did speak to board representatives and requested basic public information, such as whether a poll site is situated on a college campus, answers were often withheld until a Freedom of Information Act request was filed. Even then, Freedom of Information Act requests often went unanswered."" However, the study was able to use two other methods to determine whether campuses had a voting site: a survey of college administrators and cross-checking poll site addresses provided by boards of election. As a result, Becker said the study provides solid math on whether a college has a campus voting site. Another factor, however, involves some uncertainty. The researchers often couldn’t confirm the number of registered voters on campus. So, they used a workaround to make an estimate: They looked at colleges with 1,000 students and assumed that it was plausible that 300 of them could be registered voters who lived on campus.  ""We're listing places which could meet the requirements,"" Becker said. ""We have no idea; that's part of the whole story."" So while the study supports the notion that 36 four-year campuses had voting sites and 69 did not, or just under two-thirds, it is unable to say with certainty how many of these institutions have the minimum 300 registered voters on campus to trigger the law’s requirements. That’s an important distinction within the context of a letter designed to encourage adherence to the 2022 law. The Andrew Goodman Foundation’s Smith said such obstacles demand action from college presidents. ""Administrations will often focus on what’s being brought to their attention,"" said Smith. ""I think securing on-campus polling sites requires the active support and leadership of campus administration."" Becker said ""the vast majority of colleges in New York State do not have on-campus poll sites.""  Two studies, one of them by his own group, support the idea that a little under two-thirds of four-year New York State colleges lack a campus voting site. However, the difficulty of obtaining information about registered voters on campus makes it unclear how many of the campuses studied would be covered by the law. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. CORRECTION NOTE, April 9 and 10, 2024 : After publication, we updated this story.

""Show your Democrat friend this post when they claim voter fraud doesn’t occur,"" read the April 2 Facebook  post . ""From the Federal Social Security website (link below), you can see how many people each of the 43 states are registering to vote who DO NOT HAVE IDs.""

(Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) (Screenshot from Facebook.) The  linked page  showed the Social Security Administration’s ""Weekly Data for Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) Transactions by State January 2011 to Present Totals."" However, this data wasn’t what the post promised.  Rather than showing how many people have registered to vote without IDs, the table’s data  reflects  the number of times a state requested information from a Social Security Administration system used to verify voters’ identities.  Under the  2002 Help America Vote Act , state election officials must verify new voters’ information. States can do this by verifying a voter’s driver’s license number against the state’s Motor Vehicle Administration’s database or, in cases in which the voter does has no driver’s license, verifying the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. In response to the 2002 law, the Social Security Administration set up the Help America Vote Verification system, sometimes called the  HAVV system .  Today, the Social Security Administration  reports  that 43 states use this system to verify a person’s name, birth date and last four Social Security number digits. The table the post linked to tracks states’ requests for four-digit matches from January 2011 on. It shows how many have been processed, how many could not be processed, how many yielded matches and how many weren’t matched. The data does not reflect numbers of people, let alone people registered to vote. Sean Morales-Doyle, who directs the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said it is inaccurate to claim the table shows how many people states have registered to vote without IDs.  ""The fact that a state is verifying the last four digits of a registrant’s Social Security number does not mean that that person registered to vote without an ID,"" he said.  Federal law requires that people registering to vote in a federal election provide a driver’s license number, a state ID number, the last four digits of a Social Security number or check a box saying they have none of those things, Morales-Doyle said.  New York State’s voter registration form. (Screenshot from New York State Board of Elections) On some states’ voter registration forms, voters who have IDs and Social Security numbers could simply choose to fill in the Social Security number because it’s a number they have memorized, he said. Filling out that section of the application does not in itself mean the applicants lack IDs. States can also repeatedly request verifications on the same person’s Social Security number. In a  2010 audit  of the Social Security Administration system, the inspector general’s office found that during fiscal year 2008, 32% of transactions submitted by 25 states ""related to the same voter data being re-submitted 10 or more times."" Ohio, for example, ""submitted the same voter information 1,778 times during the year for a 77-year-old man who died in December 2005,"" the audit found.  The Social Security Administration’s press office did not immediately respond to our questions about the data. Responding to claims misrepresenting the Social Security Administration’s data, election officials in Arizona, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin said that the data  does not show  millions of people registering to vote without IDs.   Although the system was developed to verify identities when people lack driver’s license numbers, Morales-Doyle said, ""That doesn’t actually mean that every time someone is being run through this system it’s because they just registered and they don’t have a driver’s license number."" The data contains no specific information about whether the people registering had photo IDs.  ""In Pennsylvania, the Department of State uses the Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) to check partial social security numbers (SSN) not only for voter registration applications, but also for absentee and mail ballot applications,"" Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson Ellen Lyon  told PolitiFact . Robert Kehoe, a Wisconsin Elections Commission deputy administrator, said that the state’s data as it appears on the Social Security Administration’s website reflects that a voter registered without providing a state ID or driver’s license number. Wisconsin voter registrations are verified using Wisconsin Department of Transportation data or, if an ID number is unavailable, using Social Security number verification.  JP Martin, a spokesperson for Arizona’s secretary of state,  told PolitiFact  that 90% of verification of citizenship proof is done through the Motor Vehicles Division in Arizona, not through the Social Security Administration. This isn’t the first time this data has been used to amplify unsupported claims of supposed voter fraud by noncitizens. We’ve similar statements from conservative internet influencers, former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk and rated them  False . Fraudulent voter registration and voting by noncitizens  is rare  and usually happens because of a misunderstanding or a mistake. (Voting by noncitizens carries high risks that include deportation or incarceration.) Nevertheless, politicians including Trump and his allies have continuously spread  false claims  about rampant fraudulent voting by noncitizens.  Not all people without IDs are noncitizens. One  2023 survey found  that almost 21 million voting-age U.S. citizens do not have valid, unexpired driver’s licenses.  And, someone registering to vote does not mean a vote was cast, said Cassondra Knudson, a spokesperson for Minnesota’s Secretary of State. Election officials have several layers of verification to ensure only eligible voters cast ballots. A social media post claimed data on the Social Security Administration’s website showed ""how many people each of the 43 states are registering to vote who DO NOT HAVE IDs.""  That’s inaccurate: It shows the results of requests from 43 states to verify partial Social Security numbers under the Help America Vote Act. Sometimes states verify the same voter’s information multiple times, and not all verification requests are for voters registering without IDs.  We rate this claim False.

Trump said in the April 10  Truth Social post . The posts omit that Daniels later recanted her statement denying the affair. Daniels’ statement was first released Jan. 30, 2018, and it  was   widely   reported  on at the time. Soon after the statement was released, Daniels began to cast doubt on it. In an appearance on  Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show  the same day the letter was released, Daniels said she didn’t know where the statement came from and suggested the signature on it was not hers. The Associated Press  reported  Jan. 31, 2018, that Daniels’ publicist said Daniels signed the letter. On Feb. 14, 2018,  Daniels’ manager Gina Rodriguez  told the AP  that Daniels believed Cohen invalidated the nondisclosure agreement when he publicly confirmed making the $130,000 payment to her, so Daniels was free to tell her story. Then, in March 2018, Daniels recanted her statement in a  ""60 Minutes"" interview  with Anderson Cooper, saying an affair had occurred. Daniels said her previous denials were because of a nondisclosure agreement and she felt pressured by her former attorney and former business manager to sign a statement denying the affair with Trump. ""So, you signed and released — a statement that said, ‘I am not denying this affair because I was paid in ‘hush money.’ I’m denying it because it never happened.’ That’s a lie?"" Cooper asked Daniels in the interview. Daniels replied, ""Yes."" ""If it was untruthful, why did you sign it?"" Cooper asked. Daniels responded: ""Because they made it sound like I had no choice."" PolitiFact in 2023 fact-checked a claim that the 2018 letter ""debunked"" Bragg’s case and rated that  False . We rate the claim that a document shows Daniels ""exonerated"" Trump False.

politifact,"“This trial that I have now, that’s a Biden trial.”","The Manhattan district attorney’s investigation into Trump’s business records began before Joe Biden was president. By the time Trump was charged in 2023, Biden was president.     The investigation took many twists and turns, but Trump’s fighting the subpoena of his business records lengthened the timeline.     District Attorney Alvin Bragg hired a former Justice Department prosecutor in 2022. But experts told us that doesn’t prove Biden was involved.","Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought the charges against former President Donald Trump over falsifying business records to pay off adult film actor Stormy Daniels. But Trump says President Joe Biden is really the person behind the case. Trump has made the claim many times in many places. ""This trial that I have now, that’s a Biden trial,"" Trump said  April 16 in front of a New York City bodega  on the second day of jury selection. ""Two days from now, the entire world will witness the commencement of the very first Biden trial,""  he said at an April 13 rally in Pennsylvania. ""As you witness this Biden trial, I ask all Americans to remember that this is not just about me, this is about our country and this is about you,""  Trump said in an April 15 video . These statements are wrong. There is no evidence that Biden orchestrated the charges against Trump.  Bragg said in April 2023 that Trump was charged with  34 counts  of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to Daniels made through Trump’s then-attorney Michael Cohen. (Daniels’ real name is Stephanie Clifford.)  ""Alvin Bragg is an independently elected state prosecutor who has nothing to do with Biden, the (Justice Department) or the federal government,"" said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a criminal defense attorney who worked at the Manhattan district attorney’s office before Bragg took over. ""In fact, if Trump were convicted, even if he wanted to, Biden could not pardon him. It is wholly and entirely separate in every way."" We contacted a Trump campaign spokesperson for this fact-check and received no reply.   The investigation into Trump’s business records is based on New York state law. The Justice Department prosecutes only federal crimes in federal courts and cannot control state prosecutions, said  Frank O. Bowman III , a University of Missouri law professor and former local prosecutor in Denver and federal prosecutor in Florida.  ""Local district attorneys prosecute state criminal violations in state criminal courts,"" Bowman said. ""They are not under the control of the U.S. Department of Justice. Moreover, in my experience, they are fiercely independent and would resent any effort from the U.S. Justice Department to interfere in their decision-making."" The Manhattan investigation into Trump began in 2018, before Biden was president. It faced many twists, turns and delays amid the coronavirus pandemic, 2020 presidential election and lead prosecutors quitting.  After Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2018, then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. opened an investigation into the payments,  Politico reported . Federal prosecutors could not charge Trump then because of the Justice Department’s policy not to bring criminal charges against a sitting president,  Politico reported . After federal prosecutors concluded their investigation, Vance in August 2019 subpoenaed Trump’s personal and corporate tax records. Trump’s lawyers fought the subpoena, and the U.S. Supreme Court in July 2020 ruled in Vance’s favor. By the time Vance obtained the records, it was February 2021, early in Biden’s presidency. Bragg was elected to replace Vance and took office in 2022.   Any cooperation between federal and local prosecutors generally is voluntary, said Melissa Redmon, a former local prosecutor in Georgia and University of Georgia law professor. When Bragg sought federal records about Cohen’s telephone, federal prosecutors declined,  saying  ""it would be unduly burdensome."" Trump’s attorneys subpoenaed records from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. ""We would have seen much more early information sharing if the offices were acting in concert,"" Redmon said. Although Trump was implicated in Cohen’s case, federal prosecutors in New York never charged him. In earlier versions of this statement, Trump highlighted a Biden link in one of the attorneys Bragg hired to work the case.  One of Bragg’s prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo, worked for the U.S. Justice Department and the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg said he would  join the district attorney’s office  in December 2022. In March,  Trump called Colangelo  a ""radical left"" prosecutor who was ""put into the district attorney's office to run the trial against Trump.""  In his two years at the Justice Department, Colangelo helped oversee the antitrust, civil, civil rights, environment and natural resources, and tax divisions.  Colangelo served as acting associate attorney general, the department’s third-highest-ranking position, during the Biden administration’s first few months, until  Vanita Gupta  was confirmed. Colangelo then served as the principal deputy associate attorney general. Colangelo  also served in the Obama administration . When Colangelo worked for the New York attorney general, he investigated the Trump Foundation and led lawsuits against the Trump administration. The New York Times reported that Bragg and Colangelo overlapped at the attorney general’s office. But Colangelo’s presence on Bragg’s team doesn’t prove that Biden, or officials in his White House or campaign, were involved in the case. Multiple lawyers told us it’s unsurprising that Bragg would hire Colangelo, a longtime prosecutor with experience investigating Trump. Prosecutors commonly move between jobs at federal, state and high-profile local offices. ""The more relevant prior position held by Colangelo is not his DOJ jobs, but the NY AG position in which he participated in the Trump Foundation investigation,"" Bowman said. ""I'd bet that Bragg hired him in part because of his familiarity with the intricacies of Trump's businesses and financial dealings. But, again, that proves exactly nothing about Biden influence on the Manhattan case."" Bill Otis, former head of the Appellate Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and a former special counsel to former President George H.W. Bush, raised questions about Bragg hiring Colangelo. ""There are about a zillion smart lawyers on the East Coast,"" he said. ""Why does Alvin Bragg need to use one with high-level links to Biden's DOJ?"" Nevertheless, Trump is exaggerating, Otis said. Bragg hiring Colangelo ""does not prove Biden's personal involvement in investigating and/or charging Trump, but it's another smelly straw in the wind."" Trump said that ""this trial that I have now that’s a Biden trial.""  The Manhattan district attorney’s investigation of Trump began in 2018, before Biden was his party’s presidential nominee. Bragg filed the charges in 2023. Trump’s fighting a subpoena lengthened this timeline. Trump has criticized that Bragg hired Colangelo, a former Justice Department prosecutor who investigated Trump when he worked for the New York attorney general. It’s not uncommon for seasoned prosecutors to move among federal, state and local offices. Reasonable people may question the political wisdom of Bragg’s hire, but it doesn’t prove that Biden has directed the Manhattan investigation. We rate Trump’s statement False.

(Screengrab from Facebook) This post and  others   like   it   were  flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Some of these figures lack context; others are incorrect. Here’s a breakdown of how many of these eight businesses’ stores have closed during Biden’s presidency. These closures are largely because of lower sales or business rebrands; none cited Biden’s policies as the reason for the closures. This is largely accurate. Dollar Tree acquired Family Dollar in 2015 for $8 billion, and plans to close hundreds of Family Dollar stores. In March, Dollar Tree said it plans to close about 600 Family Dollar stores across the U.S. in this year’s first half, The Associated Press  reported . Over the next several years, Dollar Tree plans to close another 370 Family Dollar stores and 30 Dollar Tree locations. This is inaccurate. This number refers to the number of recent store closings for CVS, not Walgreens. Walgreens said in June 2023 that it plans to close 150 U.S. locations by August 2024, CNN  reported . In 2019, when Donald Trump was president, Walgreens said it was closing 200 stores in the U.S. CVS  said  in November 2021 that it planned to close 900 stores by 2024. Shoppers enter a Macy's department store in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, Dec. 12, 2023. (AP) This number is correct, but needs context. Macy’s Inc.  said  in February that it planned to close 150 ""underproductive"" stores in the U.S. through 2026. Fifty of these stores will close by Dec. 31. In February 2020, when Trump was in office, Macy’s announced 125 store closings, the AP  reported . This is missing context. Foot Locker said in March 2023 that it plans to close 400 stores in ""underperforming"" malls across North America by 2026, CBS News  reported . However, the company also said it will open about 300 free-standing locations focused on its ""Community,"" ""Power"" and ""House of Play"" store concepts. The company said these decisions are part of its ""Lace Up"" strategic plan to ""reset"" its business and increase revenue to $9.5 billion by 2026. This number is accurate, but the closures weren’t announced on Biden’s watch. Gap said in October 2020, when Trump was president, that it would close 350 stores, including 220 of its namesake Gap stores and 130 Banana Republic stores, in North America (not just the U.S.) by 2024, CBS News  reported . Gap’s  website  lists all of the completed store closures since 2020; it says 189 Gap stores and 134 Banana Republic stores have closed. A ""Home of the Whopper"" sign welcomes customers outside the Burger King fast food restaurant, on Feb. 1, 2021, in Epping, N.H. (AP) This figure is largely accurate. Joshua Kobza, CEO of Restaurant Brands International Inc., which owns Burger King, said in May 2023 that the company planned to close 300 to 400 U.S. locations by the end of 2023. Kobza said the company typically closes ""a couple (of) hundred"" Burger King locations each year, Restaurant Dive  reported . When contacted by PolitiFact, a Burger King spokesperson provided no details about the chain’s exact number of closures in 2023. We found no reports that this many Regal Cinemas movie theaters were closing. Cineworld, the company that owns Regal Cinemas,  said  in January 2023 that it was planning to reject leases for 39 U.S. movie theaters. This announcement came a few months after Cineworld  filed  for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, CNN reported. (Chapter 11 bankruptcy lets companies keep operating as they reorganize their assets and debts.) In September 2022, Regal Cinemas closed 12 locations. It’s unclear how many Regal Cinemas locations closed after January 2023. We contacted Regal Cinemas, but received no response. The company’s  website  says it has 426 theaters in the U.S. This is wrong. Kroger has not announced store closures. To clear a path for a merger, announced in 2022, grocery store chains Kroger and Albertsons said in 2023 they were selling 413 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers for $1.9 billion, the AP  reported . But the federal government  sued  to block the merger in February, saying the merger would lead to a less competitive market and higher prices for consumers. On April 22, Kroger and Albertsons said they would sell an additional 166 stores to appease the government’s concerns, the AP  reported . Erin Rolfes, a Kroger spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Kroger will not close any stores as a result of the merger. ""Stores divested to C&S are not stores that will be closed — they are stores that will be run in the same manner they are today, just by C&S instead of Kroger or Albertsons,"" Rolfes said. A Facebook post claimed there have been mass closures across several businesses during Biden’s presidency. Some information in the post lacked context, including that some closing announcements preceded Biden’s presidency and that some businesses were opening new stores.

(Lea más sobre  nuestra colaboración con Meta , propietaria de Facebook e Instagram). Encontramos varias publicaciones similares en  Facebook  y en  X .   Las cifras de las publicaciones en redes sociales representan el número de veces que los estados han verificado los números del Seguro Social (SSN, por sus siglas en inglés) de los votantes. Este proceso se realiza con el Help America Vote Verification (HAVV, por sus siglas en inglés). El  HAVV  es un sistema establecido en 2004 en el que los estados pueden verificar la identificación de un votante con la Administración del Seguro Social.  Los estados también utilizan el sistema para verificar a los nuevos votantes que no requieren una identificación con foto al registrarse para votar. Como resultado, el número del Seguro Social de un mismo votante podría verificarse varias veces en un mismo año. Los funcionarios electorales estatales o locales de los tres estados —incluyendo republicanos— dijeron que las cifras no reflejan con exactitud el número de votantes que se registraron sin identificación con foto. Todos los funcionarios electorales dijeron que toman medidas para garantizar que sólo los ciudadanos con derecho a votar emitan su voto y que no tienen pruebas de un registro generalizado de votantes no ciudadanos. ""Los datos no representan el número de nuevos votantes registrados, y cualquier representación que hagan es falsa"", dijo a PolitiFact Ellen Lyon, portavoz del Departamento de Estado de Pensilvania.  Texas y Arizona exigen un documento de identidad con foto para votar, pero Pensilvania no. El departamento de prensa de la Administración del Seguro Social no respondió inmediatamente a nuestras preguntas sobre su data.  Por ejemplo, en Pensilvania, según el Departamento de Estado, sólo ha habido 75,000 nuevos registros de votantes, lo que hace imposible que 580,513 votantes se registraran sin documento de identidad con foto, como afirma la publicación. ""En Pensilvania, el Departamento de Estado utiliza el Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) para comprobar parcialmente los números del Seguro Social no sólo para las solicitudes de registro de votantes, sino también para las solicitudes de voto en ausencia y por correo"", dijo Lyon.  Los datos de la Administración del Seguro Social representan el número bruto de veces que un estado comprueba la verificación del Seguro Social de un votante. La base de datos tampoco muestra el número de no ciudadanos que se registraron este año, sin un documento de identidad con foto. Tampoco verifica su estatus de ciudadanía.  En Texas, sólo 57,711 nuevos votantes se han registrado este año, según la Secretaria de Estado Jane Nelson, exsenadora republicana.  Su oficina  emitió un comunicado  en el que calificaba la cifra de 1.2 millones publicada en redes sociales como ""claramente incorrecta.""  ""Cuando los tejanos se registran para votar deben proporcionar el número de su licencia de conducir o el número del Seguro Social. Cuando una persona se registra para votar sólo con un SSN, el estado verifica que el SSN es auténtico"", explicó el comunicado. Arizona ha tomado medidas similares para contrarrestar las afirmaciones inexactas en redes sociales. Stephen Richer, registrador republicano del condado de Maricopa en Arizona,  dijo en X   que en Arizona sólo ha habido alrededor de 60,000 nuevos registros de votantes este año y las verificaciones del Seguro Social se utilizan para comprobar la prueba de identidad, no para comprobar el estatus de ciudadanía. JP Martin, portavoz del secretario de estado de Arizona, dijo a PolitiFact que el 90% de la verificación de la prueba de ciudadanía se realiza a través del Departamento de Vehículos de Motor en Arizona, no a través de la Administración del Seguro Social. En un  caso de votación en Arizona , la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos dictaminó en 2013 que los estados están obligados a permitir el registro para las elecciones federales utilizando un formulario federal que no requiere prueba documental de ciudadanía. Eso significa que Arizona proporciona a los votantes que carecen de pruebas, una boleta ""solo federal"". El estado tiene alrededor de 35,000 personas en la lista federal de los aproximadamente  4 millones de votantes , dijo Martin.  Ese número es casi ocho veces menor que la cantidad de consultas de la HAVV que se hicieron para verificar los números del Seguro Social de los votantes.  Un  artículo  de Votebeat Arizona descubrió que la mayoría de los votantes federales en Arizona, son estudiantes universitarios que no pueden acceder fácilmente a documentos que prueben su ciudadanía.  En medio de un elevado número de encuentros fronterizos este año, las cuentas virales de las redes sociales y algunos políticos, incluido el expresidente Donald Trump, han seguido  difundiendo la falsedad  del voto masivo de los no ciudadanos. Los no ciudadanos votan en alguna ocasión, pero es raro. La mayoría de los no ciudadanos no quieren arriesgarse a ir a la cárcel (o a ser deportados si están aquí ilegalmente) por votar. Los funcionarios electorales toman varias medidas para asegurarse de que sólo votan los que cumplen los requisitos.   Una publicación en Facebook afirma que los datos de la Administración del Seguro Social prueban que más de 2 millones de no ciudadanos se registraron para votar sin identificación con foto en Arizona, Pensilvania y Texas este año. Pero los datos no reflejan el número de no ciudadanos que se han registrado para votar sin una identificación con foto. Los datos muestran la cantidad de veces que los estados han verificado los números del Seguro Social de los votantes. Los estados pueden solicitar la verificación del número del Seguro Social de un mismo votante varias veces.  Funcionarios estatales de Arizona, Pensilvania y Texas dijeron que el número de personas que se registraron para votar este año, en sus respectivos estados, es significativamente menor que las cifras citadas en la publicación.  Calificamos la afirmación como Falsa.

This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) As a quick online search shows, the notion that the two candidates are not campaigning is verifiably false. The Federal Election Commission shows the amount of money Biden, Trump and  other official presidential candidates  have raised and spent in the 2024 race. There’s also broad news coverage reflecting that these candidates are campaigning.  In 2023, Biden and his allies spent more than $45 million in advertisements, a record amount for an incumbent in the off-year before the general election, NBC News  reported . In March, Biden’s campaign launched a $30 million ad buy, Politico  said , and announced the President, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff would stump ""in every battleground state"" that month. C-SPAN  has cataloged  these televised rallies, most recently showing Harris  campaigning in Pennsylvania  while Biden  was in Wisconsin .   In May, Biden debuted ""a new-seven figure ad buy … centered around abortion, a centerpiece issue for his campaign,""  according to CBS News . The Trump campaign, meanwhile,  announced  with the Republican National Committee in March that the campaign had raised more than $65 million. Trump has  likewise   rallied in battleground states  and  coverage   of   these   campaign   events   has   been   robust .""The former president's campaign events are  surreal to experience,""  one NPR report said. ""All-day affairs that are equal parts religious revival and massive pep rallies, powered by an infamous musical playlist that runs for hours before he speaks.""

politifact,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called voter ID “racist,” calls NRA a “terrorist organization” and supports affirmative action.","In 2008, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. co-authored a comic book that called voter identification  ""racially rancid."" In a 2008 interview, he said a lot of Americans don’t have a driver’s license, including Black people. But the independent presidential candidate has talked about voter ID differently during his current campaign.     After the 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, Kennedy called the National Rifle Association a ""terror group."" However in 2023, he said on Fox News ""I don’t consider the NRA a terror group.""     Kennedy made statements supporting affirmative action after a 2023 Supreme Court ruling striking down affirmative action in college admissions.","Amid independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s frequent appearances on conservative news, former President Donald Trump has taken notice. Trump, a Republican, said that a vote for Kennedy is a  ""wasted protest vote""  and that the third-party candidate is  ""far more LIBERAL  than anyone running as a Democrat."" Trump was echoing the sentiment of  radicalf-ingkennedy.com , a website of the MAGA Inc. political action committee. The Trump campaign made similar statements about Kennedy’s past positions in a  May 2 post on X .  ""RFK Jr. is a Radical Left Democrat,"" the Trump campaign account said. The campaign then said that Kennedy: Called Voter ID ""Racist"" Calls NRA a ""Terror Organization"" Supports Affirmative Action. The Trump campaign also pointed out Kennedy’s past support of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and ""praised"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who ran for president as a Democrat. In July 2016, Kennedy  endorsed Clinton’s presidential candidacy  and called himself a  ""huge admirer"" of Sanders , Clinton’s primary rival. Kennedy said in 2023 that  he had no regrets about voting for former President Obama .  Kennedy launched his presidential campaign in 2023 as a Democrat, but months later said he would run as an independent. He has taken some policy positions on the right and frequently gives  interviews to conservative media . With Kennedy’s past embrace of Democratic leaders well documented. we wanted to explore the Trump campaign’s claims about his past positions. The statements about Kennedy’s positions on voter ID, the National Rifle Association and affirmative action missed some context. Nearly two decades ago, Kennedy was critical of  laws requiring voters to present ID. In an October 2008 interview with  NBC host Rachel Maddow , Kennedy said voter ID was discriminatory. Kennedy said many Americans lack driver’s licenses, including older people, young people and Black people. ""In other words, Democratic voters,"" Kennedy said. ""One in 5 Democratic — 1 in 5 Black voters does not have a driver‘s license. That means if you require a driver‘s license, you‘re getting rid of 20% of the Black voters in this country."" Kennedy also joined journalist Greg Palast to co-author  ""Steal Back Your Vote, "" a 2008 comic book that said  nuns in Indiana  were turned away from voting because their driver’s licenses were expired. The comic book referred to voter ID as a ""racially rancid rule."" The book mentioned research about the disproportionate impact on Black voters who were less likely to have a driver’s license than white people. In a 2021 article, PolitiFact highlighted similar research conclusions, including by  academics and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . States set their own laws for voter ID , including how strictly they are applied and what forms of ID, photo or others, are accepted. Today, the majority of states require some type of voter ID.  The trend over the past two decades has been  toward   tighter   voter   ID  requirements.  But in his current presidential campaign, Kennedy has not called voter ID laws racist. Fox News’ Jesse Watters asked Kennedy on Aug. 29, 2023,  about voter ID and how his plan would address concerns about fraud and ""illegal voting.""  Kennedy replied that ""a lot of poor people, particularly people in cities who don't drive, don't have access to identification, and if we had voter ID laws, it would keep them from voting. So, it would keep a huge demographic of people from voting."" Kennedy said providing a free ID could solve this problem and did not describe voter ID laws as racist. In a  May 1 interview with Watters , Kennedy walked back his earlier comments more completely. Watters: ""You said voter ID was racist. Is that true?"" Kennedy: ""Maybe. You know, look, I had a lot of positions. I went through an evolution like many people in this country. And you know, I said things years ago, I had positions years ago that I look back on and say that was not -— there was nothing good about that. I think we — you know, listen, what I've said on the voter ID issue is that I'm going to issue voter passports — passport IDs to every American who can't afford them, that will end that issue."" ""If free ID is made available, Mr. Kennedy is in favor of voter ID requirements to assure the public of election integrity,"" Stefanie Spear, a Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spokesperson, told PolitiFact. In the aftermath of the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Kennedy described the NRA as terrorists. Kennedy tweeted Feb. 17, 2018 : ""Parkland students are right; the NRA is a terror group."" Two days earlier,  Kennedy tweeted  about Marjory Stoneman Douglas, using the abbreviation MSD: ""Let’s be honest. The NRA is as responsible for the MSD child murders as if they pulled the trigger. NRA has turned 2d Amendment into a suicide pact for our children. When do we deal with NRA?"" Kennedy deleted the post around May 2023, according to the Decensored News account . The Kennedy campaign did not answer our question about why. Kennedy walked back calling the NRA a ""terror group"" in an October 2023 interview with  Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Hannity: ""Do you still believe the NRA is a terror group?"" Kennedy Jr.: ""I support the Second Amendment, like I do all the amendments of the Constitution, and I'm not going to take people's — "" Hannity: ""I didn’t ask you if you support the Second Amendment. You called in 2018, you said, 'Parkland students are right, the NRA is a terror group.' Do you believe that?"" Kennedy Jr. ""I don’t consider the NRA a terror group."" Hannity: ""Do you regret tweeting that in 2018?"" Kennedy Jr.: ""Well, I don’t recall tweeting it in 2018. But if I did, as I said, Sean, I don’t consider them a terror group and I support the Second Amendment."" Spear, Kennedy’s campaign spokesperson, said Kennedy ""has come to understand that the gun owners represented by the NRA have a legitimate viewpoint."" In June 2023, the  U.S. Supreme Court ended affirmative action  for colleges. Kennedy tweeted  on the day of the ruling: ""Regarding the Supreme Court banning affirmative action in higher ed(ucation) — I know many Americans feel that purely race-based decisions are unfair. However, this feeling misses important context. The effects of racist policies going back centuries are now self-perpetuating. Affirmative action understands this and uses race-based policies to undo the effects of racist policies. ‘Color-blind’ admissions tend to favor those who are already in the circle of privilege. It favors those who grew up in affluent, educated households. Wouldn’t you like to invite in those who have been left out in the cold?"" Asked about Kennedy’s position about affirmative action, Spear said, ""That tweet does not advocate affirmative action per se. It was intended to highlight the need to recognize the situation that affirmative action seeks to address. He believes we must find constitutionally sound and fair ways to address the legacy of centuries of racist practices that still affect the Black community."" When we asked Kennedy’s campaign for his current position on issues including affirmative action, Kennedy’s campaign sent us to  the candidate’s policy portion of his website . The  page about the Black community  does not address affirmative action. That page of Kennedy’s website calls for ""increased trade school and college prep opportunities for our youth"" and said ""working on organic, healing farms will unlock significant assets to pay your way through college or learn a trade, start a small business or put a down payment on a home."" A Trump campaign X post said Kennedy Jr. called voter ID ""racist,"" calls NRA a ""terrorist organization"" and supports affirmative action.  The Trump campaign was careful and used the past tense ""called"" — a reference to Kennedy’s statements in 2008 in which he spoke about voter ID as racially discriminatory. But during his presidential campaign, Kennedy has talked about voter ID differently by stating that wants the government to provide free ID. In 2018, Kennedy called the NRA a ""terror group"" but in 2023 he said ""I don’t consider the NRA a terror group."" In 2023, he made statements in support of affirmative action. Overall, the Trump statement is partially accurate but is missing context, including about more recent statements that he made about voter ID and the NRA. We rate this statement Half True.

politifact,“Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel.”,"In May, the United States paused one shipment of weapons to Israel consisting of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs.     President Joe Biden said on CNN that if Israel does a full-scale assault on Rafah, ""I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem.""     Biden also said the U.S. will continue to provide aid to Israel.","President Joe Biden’s administration paused one shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel hoping to prevent a full-scale attack on Gaza — a move that former President Donald Trump condemned. ""Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel,""  Trump said May 10 on Truth Social.  ""Any Jewish person who votes for Crooked Joe Biden should have his/her head examined!"" Two days earlier, Biden said on  CNN  that he would not supply certain offensive weapons if Israel launched a full attack on cities in Rafah, though he would continue to provide military aid.  Twenty-six Democrats wrote a  letter  to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on May 10 stating they were ""deeply concerned"" about ""withholding weapons shipments to Israel, during a critical moment in the negotiations.""  Republican leaders wrote  that they were alarmed about the delay in weapons for Israel. But withholding some weapons does not equal immediately cutting off all aid to Israel. Trump’s statement is ""factually completely inaccurate,"" said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former adviser to secretaries of state from both major political parties. Days after Trump’s remark, multiple outlets including the  Wall Street Journal,    The Washington Post ,  New York Times,   Associated Press  and  CNN  citing anonymous sources,  reported  that the Biden administration told Congress it was proposing more than $1 billion in weapons agreements for Israel, including tank ammunition, tactical vehicles and mortar rounds. PolitiFact does not use anonymous sources and we were not able to corroborate that reporting. Since these news reports were published after Trump’s remarks, we did not consider them in our rating. We emailed a Trump campaign spokesperson asking for his evidence and received no response by our deadline. In his May 8 CNN interview, Biden raised concerns about civilian deaths if Israel uses bombs in heavily populated areas in Rafah.  ""If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem,"" said Biden, who added that he made his position clear to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, Biden said the U.S. was not blocking all weapons for Israel. ""We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure, in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks,"" Biden said. He later added, ""We're not walking away from Israel's security. We're walking away from Israel's ability to wage war in those areas."" Gaza residents have been fleeing their homes and the area, bracing for a full-scale attack. On May 12, the  United Nations’ relief agency  estimated that 300,000 people had evacuated. The United States paused one shipment of weapons in May consisting of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. That does not pertain to the bill Biden just signed – it is from funding from years ago.  ""This was intended as a tightly scripted pause, one shipment of high value munitions bombs to demonstrate the president’s frustration and concern that the Israelis were mounting a major military campaign against Rafah,"" Miller said. ""The administration has gone out of way in briefings to make clear this is not an arms embargo, nor an open breach of U.S.-Israeli defense commitment.""  Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, and an international affairs lecturer at George Washington University, also said Trump’s statement was wrong. ""All Biden has done is paused the shipment of 2,000 pound bombs,"" Slavin said. ""He has given no indication that he would cut aid and has specifically said defensive aid — missile defense systems in particular — would continue."" Mark Cancian, senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ international security program, agreed with Slavin that Biden’s comments do not equal a total aid cutoff for Israel.  But he offered a caveat about the administration describing its action as a ""pause."" ""We can’t be sure it is a pause until they restart it, there is that dangling question,"" he said. The U.S. has given Israel  $3 billion to $4 billion a year in military aid  during the past decade and a half. This spending was  outlined  in a 10-year, $38 billion  memorandum of understanding  the two countries signed in 2016. The memorandum cited several priorities, including updating the Israeli air fleet and maintaining the country’s missile defense system. Similar memorandums were signed under  the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations . The State Department and Department of Defense both have oversight roles for any U.S aid that Congress appropriates, and the Arms Export Control Act requires that the President  notify Congress  only of sales above a certain dollar threshold. Once the sales go through, we don’t know exactly when weapons get transferred to Israel. And the process — of aid being provided, sales approved and weapons then arriving in Israel — can take years. The  Washington Post  reported in March that the U.S. has approved and delivered more than 100 separate foreign military sales to Israel since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and the war began. The Post found that only two of those 100 sales have been made public:  $106 million  in tank ammunition and  $147.5 million  in components needed to make 155-millimeter artillery shells. White House National Security Council spokesperson  John Kirby  and  White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre  gave separate May 9 press briefings in which they said U.S. military aid to Israel will continue. That aid includes the money from the $95 billion foreign aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan that Biden approved in April.   The aid package included about  $26 billion in Israel-Gaza  assistance, including $14.3 billion for military aid to Israel and $9.3 billion for humanitarian aid. When Biden signed the legislation, he  said  the U.S. ""can help replenish Israel’s air defense and provide other critical defense so Iran can never carry out the destruction it intended with its attack 10 days ago."" Kirby told reporters, ""Weapons shipments are still going to Israel. They’re still getting the vast, vast majority of everything that they need to defend themselves."" Jean-Pierre told reporters, ""We are also committed to ensuring Israel gets every dollar appropriated in the supplemental. In addition, we just approved the latest tranche of foreign military financing, which is $827 million worth of weapons and equipment for Israel.""  The foreign military financing was approved May 7. The  foreign military financing  program lets certain countries, including Israel, buy U.S. defense equipment, services, and training. (Israel has also been allowed to use some of this aid to buy equipment from Israeli defense companies, but that domestic procurement will be phased out in the next few years, according to the  Council on Foreign Relations .) If the Biden administration had wanted to suspend all aid to Israel, it could have called for that in a recent report.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a  report  to Congress May 10 that said it was ""reasonable to assess"" that Israeli forces used weapons in Gaza that were ""inconsistent"" with international humanitarian law or best practices for avoiding civilian harm, but the report did not officially conclude that Israel violated law.  The report was required under a  National Security Memo signed by Biden  in February.  ""They were explicit in this report that Israel remains eligible for transfers,"" said Allison McManus, managing director for the national security and international policy department at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington.  Trump said, ""Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel."" That’s not what Biden said. In a CNN interview, Biden said his administration won’t supply the weapons for Israel to launch a full-scale attack on Rafah. Biden’s administration has paused sending Israel 3,500 bombs. But Biden clarified on CNN that he is not cutting Israel from all U.S. aid, a point his administration’s officials have echoed. Biden signed legislation in April that provides billions of dollars in supplemental aid to Israel on top of billions the U.S. already provides annually to Israel. Israel also continues to have access to the U.S. foreign military financing program.

It would also put in statute that a recount ""is not an investigation or an audit of the conduct of an election,"" aiming to end frivolous recounts.     The bill’s sponsor and county clerks who helped draft the legislation said it aims to clarify and improve recount procedures and will not prevent investigation of voter fraud allegations.

That’s likely one reason a proposed change to Michigan’s election laws is garnering social media attention.  ""Voter fraud investigations are being banned by Michigan lawmakers!"" read a  May 4 Facebook post .   The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We  searched Google  for ""voter fraud investigations,"" ""ban"" and ""Michigan"" and found  a May 2 article  by the conservative news website The Daily Wire. It said Michigan Senate Bill 603 would ""ban bipartisan election boards from investigating voter fraud."" That bill passed the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate on April 30  without Republican support . If it becomes law, S.B. 603 will amend Michigan’s procedures for election recounts, with a goal of prohibiting recounts when the outcome could not change the election results.  During the 2022 midterm elections, Michigan voters approved constitutional amendments related to abortion access and voting rights by  hundreds of thousands of votes . Nevertheless, a group requested  costly recounts that  could not change the election outcome; that same group had  unsuccessfully tried to  decertify Michigan’s 2020 election results  because of unproven fraud allegations.  The bill would also clarify the definition of a recount,  explicitly distinguishing  it from an election investigation, and remove some mentions of ""fraud.""  We found no indication in the  S.B. 603’s text  that the measure would prevent investigations of voter fraud allegations. Michigan election officials, a Michigan state senator, a Michigan attorney general’s office spokesperson and a voting rights group executive director all told PolitiFact that they know of no proposed legislation that would ban ""voter fraud investigations.""  State Sen. Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, who  sponsored  the bill, said it amends sections of the election code related to recounts, and does not ban investigations of fraud. Michigan law  allows candidates  who believe that a mistake or discrepancy resulted in an incorrect election result to petition for recounts.  ""Recounts are conducted solely to recount the ballots and confirm the results of the election,"" said Lindsay Oswald, county clerk and Register of Deeds for St. Joseph County, Michigan.  The bill ""makes process improvements for recounts,"" Oswald, a Republican, said. ""I do not see how it would stop lawful investigations for illegal activity."" S.B. 603 requires candidates who request recounts to ask that the number of votes being recounted exceed the margin of difference by which the election was lost.  ""We’ve seen situations where there literally was no possible outcome of a recount that was going to change the results, so then instead county clerks were spending our taxpayer dollars on, essentially, a frivolous recount,"" Chang said.  Some inaccurate claims about the bill appeared to stem from the legislation’s  definition of ""recount""  and the removal ""fraud or mistake"" as a rationale for requesting a recount. If the measure becomes law, candidates who broadly believe they were ""aggrieved on account of error"" will be able to request recounts.  A recount ""is an administrative process limited to determining the number of votes cast on ballots for each candidate seeking a particular office or determining the number of votes cast for or against a ballot question,""  the bill  reads. ""A recount is not an investigation or an audit of the conduct of an election, and a recount does not assess the qualifications of electors participating in an election or the manner in which ballots are applied for or issued to electors.""  County Clerks from both political parties who helped draft the legislation also distinguished recounts from investigations.  The bill ""simply spells out"" that recounts aren’t investigations of voter fraud, ""but rather an available option for candidates or impacted citizens to have the ballots counted to ensure that the results that were certified were correct,"" said Democrat Barb Byrum, Ingham County Clerk. ""I fail to see how voter or election fraud would be discovered by a recount.""  State Sen. Ruth Johnson, R-Holly, who served two terms as secretary of state, voted against the bill April 30 because it would remove language  she said  gives ""bipartisan county boards of canvassers in our state the authority to investigate fraud, wrongdoing, or a violation of the law in our elections."" A spokesperson for her office pointed to a portion of  law  that said the board of canvassers has the power, if there is probable cause, to subpoena witnesses, open ballot boxes and examine ballots. After that, if canvassers had ""good reason to believe"" fraud had occurred, they were responsible for reporting their findings in writing for a prosecutor or judge.  S.B. 603 repeals that language. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s Christopher Thomas, who served as Michigan’s elections director for 36 years under Democratic and Republican secretaries of state, testified in support of the bill during a  May 14 Michigan House hearing .  Thomas, who was Board of State Canvassers secretary from 1981 to 2017, said that in practice, boards of canvassers have not conducted fraud investigations.  The board’s ""investigatory powers"" expire as soon as a recount is certified, Thomas said, and there is ""no time to conduct an investigation and complete a recount by the timelines required so that the successful candidates can take office.""  He also said recount petitioners themselves rarely have time to investigate and allege specific instances of fraud when requesting ballots be retabulated.  ""Most petitions that come in are based on the fact that it’s a close election,"" Thomas said. ""Rarely, if ever, that I recall could anybody specify any fraud that they were basing their recount on.""  Oswald said that election officials or voters can report suspected election law violations to local law enforcement officials, county prosecutors, the state Bureau of Elections and the attorney general.  ""I have never had an investigation triggered by a recount,"" she said, adding that election officials would reach out to the appropriate law enforcement entity for anything ""observed or reported as illegal.""  Voters wait in line outside the municipal offices before polls close on Election Day in Shelby Township, Mich., in Macomb County, Nov. 3, 2020. (AP) Quentin Turner, executive director of Common Cause Michigan, a voting rights group, said recounts are handled by election administrators who lack the authority to investigate criminal fraud.  ""Voter fraud is a crime and investigations into crime can only be done by law enforcement,"" Turner said. Investigations into possible election improprieties ""would be triggered by a report of some manner of illegal activity as defined by Michigan state statute,"" Byrum said. People who suspect voter fraud is occuring can address their concerns ""at the proper time in the proper way,"" Byrum said.  ""For instance, there are some who are spreading the false accusation that people are voting who shouldn’t be,"" she said. ""We have election challengers that are nominated by political parties or other organizations who may be present in any precinct location and watch and challenge a voter’s qualifications. The time to do that is not at a recount, which is what this bill clarifies."" During the May 14 House hearing, Joe Rozell, Oakland County elections director, testified in support of the bill and said that people at recounts who observe something they suspect is fraudulent may freely file criminal complaints to law enforcement. A law isn’t required to permit that. In 2018, for example, Rozell said officials suspected a local clerk had committed fraud and, ""absent any statute, we reported it to the secretary of state and the attorney general, there was an investigation, and that election official subsequently plead ‘no contest’ to a felony and was removed from office.""   A Facebook post says, ""Voter fraud investigations are being banned by Michigan lawmakers!"" Our review found one piece of legislation that would change the scope of one entity that oversees election processes. That legislation, S.B. 603, does not ban voter fraud investigations.  Critics noted that Michigan S.B. 603 would strike one provision from existing law that says boards of canvassers can investigate fraud and report it to the appropriate enforcement authority. Michigan election experts said in practice, canvassing boards lack the time to investigate fraud while conducting a recount. And anyone can report suspected fraud to the appropriate authorities — including canvassing board members — even without a statutory obligation.  An S.B. 603 bill sponsor and county clerks from both parties said the bill is aimed at clarifying the purpose of recounts, which are to retabulate ballots to ensure that an election’s results are correct — they are not criminal fraud investigations.  Law enforcement handles fraud investigations.

Johnson, R-La., referred to voter registration forms that ask applicants to check a box noting that they are U.S. citizens. ""If a nefarious actor wants to intervene in our elections, all they have to do is check a box on a form and sign their name,""  Johnson said . ""That's it. That's all that's required.

President Joe Biden has ""welcomed millions and millions of illegal aliens"" and ""the millions that have been paroled can simply go to their local welfare office or the DMV and register to vote,"" Johnson said.  Are millions of people who came in under humanitarian parole able to register to vote? The Biden administration has  admitted  about 1 million people into the U.S. through different humanitarian parole programs that grant people temporary legal permission to live and work in the United States. But the people participating in these programs are not U.S. citizens, and it would be a crime for them to register to vote in federal elections. In 1996, Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections as part of a  broader toughening of penalties  for people in the country illegally. States banned it decades earlier. ""Noncitizens"" includes people legally and illegally in the U.S. Safeguards already exist to prevent noncitizen voting.  Think tanks,   academics ,  courts  and  journalists  have  analyzed  claims about noncitizen voting for  years  and have found only  sporadic cases  that wouldn’t swing federal elections. Johnson did not say how many noncitizens had illegally voted. ""We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it’s not been something that is easily provable,"" Johnson said at the May 8 press conference. ""We don’t have that number.""  The Republican bill would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. However, in 2013, the  U.S. Supreme Court ruled  in an Arizona case that states must permit people to register for federal elections using a  federal form  that does not require documentary proof of citizenship. States may have their own form, but they must also accept the federal form.  People’s eligibility for public benefits or driver’s licenses doesn’t mean they’re allowed to register to vote.  Humanitarian parole beneficiaries  qualify  for certain federal benefits, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid and Medicare. But to qualify for the benefits, many need to have lived in the U.S. with parole, or another qualifying status, for at least five years. Once they’re in the U.S., parole program participants must apply for a legal status, such as asylum.  Generally, people under humanitarian parole programs  qualify for driver’s licenses , though rules vary by state.  Still, only U.S. citizens can register to vote.  A Johnson spokesperson pointed us to a news  article  about a letter a South Carolina state representative sent the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division requesting an investigation after a refugee received voter registration forms at the South Carolina Medicaid Office.  But receiving a voter registration form does not mean someone is registered to vote, John Michael Catalano, South Carolina State Election Commission’s public information officer told PolitiFact. The commission told PolitiFact it  found no incidents  in which non-U.S. citizens with state IDs or driver’s licenses had voted.  A South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said even though the agency provides voter registration forms, the state’s election commission reviews them.  The news article mentioned the  National Voter Registration Act of 1993 , which says that any office providing public assistance must offer voter registration. However, the law also says voter registration applications must specify that only citizens can register and applicants must affirm that they are citizens under penalty of perjury.  ""This affirmation is a big deal — not just ‘checking a box’ like Speaker Johnson suggested,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Brennan Center Voting Rights Program at New York University school of law. ""Making a false claim of citizenship on a voter registration form is a  federal criminal offense  that carries steep penalties, including deportation."" Fraudulent voter registration is often a result of misunderstandings or errors. For example, some noncitizens accidentally register to vote when applying for a driver’s license. But the number of  people who fall into this category is ""minuscule,"" Rutgers University political science professor Lorraine Minnite  previously told us .  Nationwide, from 2020 to 2022 about 55% of voter registrations forms were filled out at motor vehicle departments, the  Election Assistance Commission  data shows. About 1.4% of voter registration applications came from public assistance offices. The other registrations were largely submitted online, via mail or in person. The federal database Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or  SAVE , lets states check someone’s immigration or citizenship status. But only a few use it to check for voter registration purposes. Georgia found that there were  1,634 noncitizens who tried to register to vote over 25 years  — there were about 7 million on the voter rolls in 2022 when the state released this data. But none of the 1,634 were registered.  States often use driver’s license records to vet eligibility, but this method  isn’t foolproof . People illegally in the country can get driver’s licenses in  some states . Also, noncitizens driver’s licenses may later become naturalized citizens. Johnson said ""the millions (of immigrants) that have been paroled can simply go to their local welfare office or the DMV and register to vote."" About 1 million people have entered the U.S. during the Biden administration through humanitarian parole programs. Some of them can qualify for driver’s licenses and public benefits. And motor-vehicle departments and public benefit offices must provide people with voter registration forms under a federal law. But it is illegal for people under humanitarian parole to register to vote because they are not U.S. citizens. If a noncitizen granted parole submits a voter registration application, election officials would vet it; just submitting a form doesn’t automatically register a person to vote. Noncitizen voting is rare and Johnson provided no data to prove it’s a widespread problem. We rate this statement False.

The claim that Woodall printed 64,000 ballots and had employees fill them out to favor Joe Biden originated with a Wisconsin man who has filed numerous lawsuits against Wisconsin officials, none of which have produced evidence of this claim.     Milwaukee ballots are printed by city vendors, and the city does not have the capability to print 64,000 ballots, the mayoral spokesperson said.","Six months before the 2024 presidential election, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson replaced the head of the city’s election commission. The change had social media users claiming the change was motivated by the discovery of fraudulent activity in the 2020 election. Johnson on May 6 replaced Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall, nominating her deputy, Paulina Gutiérrez, to replace her.  A May 6  X post  alleged that Woodall had been fired after printing ballots and recruiting employees to fill them out. ""Recently FIRED Claire Woodall-Vogg printed 64,000 ballots in a back room at City Hall in Milwaukee and had random employees fill them out. Miraculously Biden took the lead in the middle of the night,"" said the post, which had been viewed more than 410,000 times as of May 21. ""64,000 ballots. The margin in the presidential election was 20,000!!!"" In a  reply  to her X post, the user shared  a separate X post  from a Wisconsin man who accused Woodall of ""printing ballots in the back conference room. That man filed a  2021 lawsuit  against Woodall, alleging she and others printed ballots in a back room at City Hall in fall 2020. We found  multiple  social media posts and conservative media  articles  and  videos  making  similar  allegations about Woodall, some of them also citing the 64,000 ballot figure.  There are some  unknowns  about  why  Woodall was replaced, according to reporting by PolitiFact’s partners at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But there’s no evidence that Woodall printed tens of thousands of ballots in a back room and had workers fill them out. A spokesperson for Milwaukee’s mayor told PolitiFact that Woodall was not replaced for any improper conduct related to the 2020 election. Jeff Fleming, a Johnson spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Woodall did nothing improper in the 2020 election. The  2021 civil lawsuit  that alleged she did is not connected to the mayor’s decision, he said. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters have long baselessly claimed that Trump won the Wisconsin vote in 2020 and that there was election fraud found that tipped the state’s election to Biden. Neither claim is accurate,  PolitiFact has reported . Biden won statewide by nearly 20,700 votes. Many conspiracy theories about Wisconsin’s election stem from absentee votes being added to the tally late at night. Wisconsin law  does not allow  clerks to process absentee ballots until polls open on Election Day, so many Milwaukee votes  were reported  late  on election night and early the next morning. When news of Woodall’s replacement broke, Johnson didn’t give a reason for the change when he  responded  to news  reporters ’ questions, but he did say she wasn’t fired. He  said she had been offered another position  that she chose not to accept.  ""There was absolutely no evidence, indication, or credible information of any improper action related to the conduct of elections or the counting of votes,"" Fleming said. Fleming said Woodall remains on the city payroll in support of the election commission for at least the next two months. He said that Johnson also made leadership changes in two other cabinet positions, which state law allows a mayor to do upon inauguration for a new term, which happened April 16. Woodall told PolitiFact the mayor ""decided to go a different direction with his appointment."" She did not accept the other position, she said, because it did not yet exist and hadn’t been formally approved. There were many details to still be worked out, she said. ""I decided it was best for us to focus on a transition plan and to seek new opportunities outside of city employment after I assist with this transition,"" Woodall said. Election workers, right, verify ballots as recount observers, left, watch Nov. 20, 2020, during a Milwaukee hand recount of presidential votes at the Wisconsin Center. (AP) The 64,000 figure appears to have originated with a Wisconsin man named Peter Bernegger, who has referred to it in other  X posts . Bernegger was  convicted of bank and mail fraud  in Mississippi in 2009, unrelated to any elections. In February, Wisconsin prosecutors accused Bernegger of falsifying a 2023 subpoena in an election-related case, and he was  charged  with ""simulating legal process,"" a  felony . There’s a preliminary hearing for Bernegger scheduled for June 20. The Wisconsin Elections Commission in 2022  fined Bernegger  more than $2,400 for making frivolous election complaints. He has  filed at least 18 lawsuits  against Wisconsin election officials alleging fraud. We reached out to Bernegger by email through his organization,  Election Watch , but received no response. Woodall said she doesn’t know how Bernegger arrived at ""this magical 64,000 number."" ""I can assure you I did not print 64,000 ballots and that does not appear in the deposition,"" Woodall said. Bernegger filed a 2021 open records lawsuit against Woodall. Although the lawsuit didn’t refer to the 64,000 figure, he accused Woodall and others of printing ballots in a City Hall conference room. That number did come up in Woodall's April 13, 2022, deposition in that case, provided to PolitiFact by Milwaukee Assistant City Attorney Peter Block. But it wasn’tin the context Bernegger described in his  X post .  Bernegger asked about an absentee ballot application, which Woodall said are used for voters seeking in-person absentee ballots. Bernegger asked how many were accepted by Woodall's office in the November 2020 election, and she said between 60,000 and 64,000. She did not, however, say anything about printing those ballots in a City Hall back room.  Block said the Milwaukee County Circuit Court ruled against Bernegger and dismissed the case last year, but Bernegger has appealed to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, which has not reached a decision. Fleming said it’s not physically or logistically possible for the city to print 64,000 ballots in a back room at City Hall. ""The city does not maintain commercial printing capabilities, which would be needed to print tens-of-thousands of ballots,"" he said. All ballots are printed by city vendors, unless a ward exceeds anticipated turnout, Fleming said. In those cases, small batches of new ballots can be printed, he said. ""There would be dozens printed, not the thousands that are falsely claimed,"" Fleming said. An X post claimed the Milwaukee Election Commission’s executive director was fired after she ""printed 64,000 ballots in a back room at City Hall in Milwaukee and had random employees fill them out,"" giving Biden a lead in the 2020 election. The 64,000 figure originated from an  X post  by a man who has been convicted of fraud and currently faces felony charges in Wisconsin of simulating a legal process. He has filed at least 18 lawsuits against Wisconsin election officials and has been fined by a state commission for making frivolous claims. None of them have produced evidence that Woodall printed 64,000 ballots. A mayoral spokesperson said Woodall was not replaced as director because of any improper conduct during the election, and that the city lacks the capability to print that many ballots.

Biden was “locked and loaded” and “ready to take me out.”,"An FBI operations order for the search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, included language about the Justice Department’s lethal force policy.     The policy says that officers ""may use deadly force only when necessary,"" such as when a subject poses an imminent danger of death or physical injury.     The FBI said it followed standard protocol in the search, which includes a standard statement about the use of deadly force. Former FBI agents told PolitiFact it’s standard to include such a policy statement.","Former President Donald Trump in a May 21 campaign email and social media posts falsely accused President Joe Biden of putting his life at risk in an August 2022 FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago. ""BREAKING FROM TRUMP: BIDEN’S DOJ WAS AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT ME!"" read an all-caps subject line on an email from Trump’s campaign. ""It’s just been revealed that Biden’s DOJ was authorized to use DEADLY FORCE for their DESPICABLE raid in Mar-a-Lago. You know they’re just itching to do the unthinkable…Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger,"" the email said. Trump made similar claims in posts on  Truth Social  and  Instagram , saying he ""was shown reports"" that ""Biden’s DOJ"" authorized the FBI to use deadly force in the Mar-a-Lago raid, calling Biden a ""serious threat to democracy."" Trump’s Republican congressional allies Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., accused Biden of  planning to assassinate  Trump and  ordering a hit  on him. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., in an  X post  called it a ""weaponization of government"" against Trump by his top political opponent. Social  media   users  also  shared  Trump’s  claim  about deadly force being  authorized . DC_Draino, a prominent conservative X account, said in a  May 22 X post  with more than 800,000 views that Attorney General Merrick Garland ""wanted a shootout"" at Mar-a-Lago.  Trump faces  40 federal charges in a federal case  over his handling of classified documents. The claim takes Trump’s rhetoric about a politicized Justice Department investigation to new levels by invoking a threat of violence. Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago during the search. He was residing in his Bedminster, New Jersey, home, and was at Trump Tower in New York when the search happened,  ABC News reported .  Lawyers in Trump’s criminal trial and a campaign spokesperson did not return PolitiFact’s request for comment. Trump’s comments followed reports  by the New York Post  and  Fox News  about newly unsealed documents in the federal classified documents criminal trial. In a February court filing,  Trump’s attorneys  made a motion to suppress evidence found in the search. Trump’s attorneys in that motion referred to an FBI ""operations order"" that included a policy statement about the ""use of deadly force."" The statement, according to Trump’s lawyers, said ""law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.""  That summary of the statement is different from what the FBI said and omits language that limits when deadly force can be used. The  operations order  included a policy statement on the use of deadly force, dated July 19, 2022. It said, ""Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person."" Similar language is found on the Justice Department's  online manual  and an FBI frequently asked questions  webpage . The operations order also included language saying that the Justice Department and FBI would notify Trump's attorney the morning of the search and request collaboration and assistance. It said that the search would require coordination with the Secret Service and Mar-a-Lago guest services.  It also noted that team leaders and on-scene command should be dressed in business attire and that case agents would be dressed in business casual attire with unmarked Polo or collared shirts, and that law enforcement equipment, including weapons and handcuffs, would be concealed. The FBI said in an emailed statement to PolitiFact that it ""followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.""  FBI experts told PolitiFact that law enforcement officers always have the authority to use deadly force if needed, and it’s typical for the FBI to include that written policy in an operations order, such as the Mar-a-Lago search. The FBI also searched  Biden's home  in January and the  Penn Biden Center  in November after Biden's lawyers reported finding classified documents from his time as vice president. The FBI also searched former Republican Vice President Mike Pence's  Indiana home  in February 2023 after Pence reported finding a small number of classified documents. Neither Biden nor Pence were charged in those cases. It's not clear whether operations orders were created in those cases as both searches were voluntary. The FBI did not respond to a question about those searches. David Shapiro, a former FBI special agent and a lecturer and program director at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the ""potential need to use deadly force can arise in any FBI operation,"" even if it's consensual. He said the agents’ weapons were concealed in the Mar-a-Lago search and likely would have also been in searches of Biden's or Pence's homes and offices. Luke William Hunt, a former FBI special agent and a University of Alabama associate philosophy professor, said FBI agents are law enforcement officers who carry firearms as part of their job description. ""So they're always permitted to use deadly force in a way that's consistent with the Constitution and internal policies,"" Hunt said. Hunt said an operations order is standard procedure when the FBI is carrying out any operation, such as a search or arrest warrant. It details everyone's role in the plan, and there's nothing unusual about including the FBI's deadly force policy in the internal document. ""That's simply to reiterate when you can and cannot use deadly force. It's almost like a reminder,"" Hunt said. ""That's just the standard deadly force policy the FBI always has and you would put that in any operations plan."" Shapiro said language about the use of deadly force ""is normally embedded in search warrants for what should be obvious reasons,"" such as the ""risk of conflict escalation initiated by others."" The general policy applied to the Mar-a-Lago search as it would in any operation, Shapiro said. ""The Mar-a-Lago search was ordered to be conducted according to the policies applicable generally to FBI operations,"" Shapiro said. ""Agents facing a credible imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm to themselves, or others, were properly advised that the Mar-a-Lago search would be executed without any exceptional limitations unnecessarily endangering themselves or others."" Trump said ""Biden’s DOJ"" was authorized to use deadly force and was ""ready to take me out"" in its raid of Mar-a-Lago. An FBI operations order Trump’s attorneys referred to in a court filing included language about the department’s deadly force policy — which Trump, his legal team and online supporters took out of context to back their claims the FBI was prepared to shoot Trump. The FBI statement said officers can use deadly force ""only"" when they reasonably believe they or someone else is in imminent danger of death or serious physical injury. This is standard protocol for search warrants. The order did not specify that Trump should be targeted; agents knew he was not at Mar-a-Lago at the time of the search.

The U.S. outbreak was first reported among wild birds in 2022, and has infected more than 92 million birds. The first description of bird flu in history dates to 1878 in northern Italy and the H5N1 strain was first found in 1996 in southern China.       Three human cases have been reported in this outbreak. Human cases of bird flu are rare, and no human-to-human transmission has been reported in the current outbreak.","World Health Organization Chief Scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar expressed concern in an April 18 news conference about an outbreak of the bird flu, known as H5N1, at U.S. dairy farms. He urged health officials to better monitor and prepare in case the virus evolves and begins spreading among humans. At least three U.S. farm workers have been infected with the virus, but there’s no evidence of human-to-human transmission, Farrar said, calling it a ""global zoonotic animal pandemic."" Nevertheless, some social media users are using his words and other bird flu news to suggest that unknown actors are planning a new pandemic in an election year. ""Tell me the Presidential elections coming up without telling me Presidential elections coming up,"" a  May 12 Instagram post  said in sticker text on a video of Farrar speaking about avian influenza. The post noted that 70 people In Colorado are ""under surveillance for having potentially contracted bird flu,"" and included the hashtags #WAKEUPAMERICA, #BYDESIGN AND #SCAMDEMIC. It’s unclear how the poster thinks a bird flu pandemic would affect the  U.S. elections in November. But the claim echoes similar  widely debunked claims  that elites planned the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, also an election year. Some of them  said COVID-19 was created  to hurt former President Donald Trump’s chances at re-election.

(Instagram screenshot) The Instagram post shared clips of Farrar  at the April 18 WHO news conference  in Geneva., responding to a question about the bird flu virus that has spread globally, infecting dairy cows in the U.S. The H5N1 virus has been found in U.S. birds since 2022 and has infected  more than 92 million birds  in 48 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The virus has spread to mammals, with  outbreaks reported  in dozens of dairy herds in nine states.  But there is no bird flu pandemic in the U.S., at least among humans. Farrar urged strong surveillance of the virus so health officials can be prepared with vaccines and therapeutics should it evolve to spread between humans. ""The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens — but now increasingly mammals — that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,"" he said. Avian influenza  is not a planned or engineered virus. It occurs naturally among wild birds, such as ducks and geese that can also infect domestic birds, such as chickens and turkeys, and mammals.  Highly pathogenic strains  of the virus can cause severe infection and death in birds. There have been global bird flu outbreaks in animals throughout the years, including  in the U.S. in 2014-15 . The first  description  of the bird flu was in 1878 in northern Italy. The H5N1 strain was  first found in waterfowl  in China in 1996. Human cases of bird flu  are rare , but have occurred globally for nearly three decades, the CDC said. The virus is frequently lethal to humans — about 52% of the 887 people diagnosed with the virus worldwide since 2004 have died, the  WHO said. The CDC said the  risk is low for humans  and that the risk depends on exposure to infected animals. Thus far, only two people — a  Texas dairy farm worker  in April and a  Michigan farm worke r in May — have been infected with the bird flu linked to dairy farms; each had reported mild symptoms. An earlier human case was diagnosed in a Colorado poultry farm worker in 2022. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment  told CBS News  earlier this month that about 70 dairy farm workers from two farms were being monitored for bird flu symptoms after being exposed to the virus. A claim that the bird flu outbreak in the U.S. is being planned to affect the U.S. presidential elections ignores that the H5N1 virus occurs naturally and that bird flu has existed for more than a century.

Noncitizens can also vote on local referendums, ballot initiatives and recalls. As of April 30,  372 noncitizen residents  had registered to vote, according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections. With  450,750 total  registered voters as of that date, noncitizens comprised less than 1% of the district’s registered voters. As of May 29, the number of registered noncitizen voters had increased to 523,  Sarah Winn Graham, Board of Elections communications director, wrote in an email to PolitiFact. Latest figures for total registered voters as of the end of May will be published in early June, she added.  The first local election in which noncitizens are eligible to vote  will take place  June 4. The law also  lets  immigrants in the U.S. illegally who are living in Washington, D.C., vote in these local elections.

Other cities that allow noncitizen residents to vote in local elections and referendums include  San Francisco  (school board elections only),  Hyattsville, Maryland , and  Burlington, Vermont . Noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections in the District of Columbia or anywhere else in the U.S. A  1996 law passed by Congress  explicitly banned noncitizens from voting in federal elections such as for president, U.S. senators or the House of Representatives.

None of these representatives have any voting power in the U.S. legislature. However in U.S. presidential elections, its residents have  three Electoral College votes . PolitiFact has found that  voting by noncitizens is rare  and not enough to change the outcome of federal elections. Registered noncitizen voters in the District of Columbia receive only ballots marked ""local"" and ""voter information is stored in a separate component within our Voter Focus database system and the physical voter registration form is a different color (yellow),"" Graham said.  Washington, D.C.’s unique territorial status allows the U.S. Congress to block local laws.

He referred to the West Point Class of 20204 motto, ""Like None Before,"" saying that West Point  graduates ""have kept us free through every challenge and danger, you must keep us free at this time, ‘like none before.’""     He said ""every generation has an obligation"" to defend American democracy and noted that graduates took an oath to the U.S. Constitution, not to a political party or president.","President Joe Biden delivered a commencement speech May 25 to graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and one social media post described a moment we didn’t see.  ""Joe Biden just told the military to be stand back and stand by because he will be calling on them to ‘defend democracy’ in case the 2024 election doesn’t go his way,"" text on an  Instagram post  said. The poster, conservative commentator Joey Mannarino, also said Biden told the graduates, ""stand back and stand by because, if Donald J. Trump wins the 2024 election, I am going to call on y’all to make sure that doesn’t happen.’ … Joe Biden basically told everybody he is not planning to accept the results of the 2024 election.""  This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) PolitiFact contacted Mannarino through his X and Instagram accounts but did not get a response.  The phrase ""stand back and stand by"" refers to  comments  then-President Donald Trump made during a 2020 presidential debate with Biden when moderator Chris Wallace asked him whether he would condemn white supremacist groups and militants. In his answer, Trump addressed the far-right group Proud Boys, saying, ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by."" Biden, in his  recent address  to West Point, did not mention the 2024 election or ask West Point graduates to keep him in power if he was not reelected. He referred to the preservation of American democracy, which he has made a  centerpiece of his reelection campaign .  Here’s what Biden said, according to a transcript of the speech.  Acknowledging the Class of 2024’s motto, ""Like None Before,"" Biden said: ""And just as this historic institution helped make America free over two centuries ago, and just as generations of West Point graduates have kept us free through every challenge and danger, you must keep us free at this time, ‘like none before.’"" He also said, ""From the very beginning, nothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America. Every generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it."" Biden also said graduates took an oath to the U.S. Constitution, not to a political party or president.  The Instagram post refers to a  Politico  article about the speech. Although the article said the speech had ""clear political undertones,"" it does not mention Biden asking graduates to fight for him if he loses the 2024 election. Biden has not said that he would not accept the 2024 election’s results, but he has said he believes  there’s a strong chance Trump will not . Trump  on May 1 told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  that he  may not accept the results  out of Wisconsin, a battleground state.   We rate the claim that Biden told the West Point graduates that ""he is not planning to accept the results of the 2024 election"" and he wants them to ""stand back and stand by"" to make sure Trump doesn’t win False. ",false,Instagram posts,2024-05-27,2024-05-30,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Biden_West_Point_1/5cc9203323eca35ebc3635a7bb7c8b7f.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/may/30/instagram-posts/no-biden-didnt-tell-west-point-graduates-he-wont-a/,"Elections, Instagram posts"
politifact,“Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election.”,"Former President Donald Trump was convicted by a Manhattan, New York, jury May 30 of 34 felonies. His sentencing is set for July 11.     Trump’s sentence could be stayed pending an appeal.      In Trump’s home state of Florida, where he is registered to vote, the Department of State website says that ""a felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted.""      New York restores the right to vote for people convicted of felonies upon release from imprisonment. If people convicted of felonies are not imprisoned, they remain eligible to vote.","Former President and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s felony conviction in New York raised questions about what comes next. Trump can still  run for president , but claims about his voting eligibility followed the May 30 verdict.  ""Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election,"" Florida state Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Sunny Isles Beach,  wrote  on X after the verdict. ""He can thank Florida Republicans for that."" Pizzo’s X post received a corrective, crowdsourced community note detailing what legal experts have  previously told us : Trump likely would not lose his voting rights. Many legal experts, including the  Campaign Legal Center , a nonprofit group that supports voting rights, said Trump’s ability to vote hinges on whether he is in prison on Election Day. Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election. He can thank Florida Republicans for that. Trump’s sentencing is  scheduled  for July 11. Many  legal  experts  have expressed doubt that Trump will be sentenced to prison because the charge is a nonviolent, low-level felony and he has no previous convictions.  ""We are going to be appealing this scam,"" Trump said at a May 31  press conference  at Trump Tower in New York. It is widely expected that the appeal process will extend beyond Election Day.  When we contacted Pizzo for comment, he said Trump would not have the right to vote until all the terms of his sentence had been satisfied, citing Florida law. We found that Florida defers to other states’ laws when the conviction is in their jurisdiction. Pizzo also acknowledged that Trump can vote while appealing his conviction.  ""Sen. Pizzo's statement holds true for someone convicted of a felony in Florida or in federal court — but Trump was convicted in state court in New York,"" Blair Bowie, director of the Restore Your Vote program at the Campaign Legal Center, told PolitiFact. ""Trump will not lose his right to vote in this case unless he is in prison on Election Day."" States  pass laws about whether people convicted of felonies lose their voting rights and if so, how they can regain them.  Trump lives in Florida. People convicted in Florida of most felonies lose their voting rights until they serve their entire sentence, including prison time, probation and paying fines, according to the  Florida Department of State . (Murder and sexual offense felonies make people ineligible to vote unless the  State Clemency Board  restores their rights.)  However, Trump was convicted in New York. And  according to  Florida’s Department of State, ""a felony conviction in another state makes a person ineligible to vote in Florida only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted."" New York law passed a 2021 law  that restores voting rights for people convicted of felonies upon their release from prison. People convicted of felonies don’t lose the right to vote unless they are in prison serving their sentences. And people whose prison sentences are stayed pending appeal do not lose their voting rights, Kathleen R. McGrath, a New York state Board of Elections spokesperson, told  PolitiFact .  After Trump is sentenced, it is highly likely his lawyers will file a motion to the appeals court asking that the sentence be stayed during the appeal. In 99% of cases involving white-collar defendants, that motion is granted, said Evan Gotlob, a former local and federal prosecutor.   ""Former President Trump would therefore need to be actually incarcerated during the time of the November election to lose his ability to vote,""  said Neil Volz , the deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the group that advocated for Florida’s 2018 constitutional  amendment  restoring felon voting rights. University of Florida political science professor  Michael McDonald , an expert on disenfranchisement of people convicted of felonies, told PolitiFact, ""Trump may, in fact, be removed from the voter rolls but it seems highly unlikely he will be removed by November."" ""The most reasonable scenario here is that Trump remains on the voter rolls,"" McDonald said. ""He could be sentenced to prison, and he could be serving time by the time we get to November, I guess I can’t rule out that possibility, but it seems like a very remote possibility."" In 2018,  Floridians voted  in favor of the amendment that restores the voting rights of people with felony convictions after those people complete the terms of their sentences. Previously, people with felony convictions had to seek to regain their voting rights through the state  clemency board .  Florida state officials, including from the Department of State, have not responded to PolitiFact’s questions about Trump’s voting rights. Trump is a registered voter in Palm Beach County.  Pizzo said, ""Trump can’t vote for himself in the November election."" This is premature and against the odds. The Florida Department of State says a felony conviction in another state invalidates the right to vote in Florida only if ""the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted."" That means New York’s laws would apply to Trump. In that state, people convicted of felonies lose the right to vote only while incarcerated.  Trump is scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Even if he receives prison time — which many legal experts said they think is unlikely —  it would be stayed pending an appeal that is likely to extend beyond Election Day. Pizzo’s statement contains an element of truth because it cannot be ruled out that Trump would be incarcerated on Election Day and therefore unable to vote for himself. But the statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression: Trump has said he will appeal his conviction. This would stay his sentence until the appeal is complete — widely expected to be after Election Day.  We rate this statement Mostly False.  RELATED:   Following guilty verdict, fact-checking Donald Trump on Biden’s role, being a ‘political prisoner’",barely-true,Jason Pizzo,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP24152601506143/11f89ba94177722dad58be43583fe01b.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/may/31/jason-pizzo/donald-trump-is-likely-able-to-vote-in-november-de/,"National, Elections, Florida, New York, Jason Pizzo"
politifact,"Under federal law, former President Donald Trump’s “felony convictions mean he can no longer possess guns.”","Federal law prohibits people with felony convictions from possessing or acquiring firearms.     Former President Donald Trump is also prohibited from possessing a gun under state laws in Florida, where he lives, and in New York, where he was convicted.     Trump has said in the past that he owns guns, but it’s unclear whether he does in 2024.","After a jury found former President Donald Trump guilty on 34 felony counts, some social media users pointed to how this conviction affects his Second Amendment rights. A May 30  X post  said, ""Under federal law, Trump's felony convictions mean he can no longer possess guns."" Other social media posts  made   similar  claims, drawing more than 1,000 engagements each. Giffords Law Center, which advocates for gun violence prevention; Jobin Joseph, an attorney with New York law firm  Rosenblum Law ; and Adam Winkler, a University of California, Los Angeles, law professor, told PolitiFact this statement is accurate. Federal law  generally prohibits the possession of firearms by, and the sale of firearms to, a person convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year — typically a felony. Because of these felony convictions, Trump is also barred from possessing a gun under state laws in  Florida , where he lives, and in  New York , where he was convicted, according to Giffords Law Center. People convicted of a felony in New York can have their gun rights restored in some cases. Because Trump’s 34 felony counts were all Class E, meaning they are less severe crimes, he would be eligible for gun rights restoration. To restore his gun rights, Trump could apply for a "" Certificate of Relief from Disabilities "" so long as his 34 felony counts are considered part of the same criminal occurrence, Joseph said. If Trump were convicted of additional felonies in another court case, Joseph said, then he would have to take a different approach and apply for a ""Certificate of Good Conduct,"" after a waiting period dependent on the crime’s severity. Trump was not convicted of these felony counts in Florida, so he could not regain his gun rights under that  state’s law . In a 2012  Washington Times interview , Trump said that he had a concealed carry permit in New York City and he owns ""a couple of different guns,"" including a ""H&K (Heckler & Koch) .45 and a .38 Smith & Wesson."" In 2016, Trump  told a French publication  that he ""always"" carries a weapon. It’s unclear whether Trump still owns firearms.

politifact,Photo shows the judges who will hear the appeal of former President Donald Trump’s criminal conviction.,"Former President Donald Trump was convicted on 34 criminal felony counts. He is expected to appeal, but experts told PolitiFact it is impossible to know now exactly which New York justices might hear his appeal of the ruling.     If Trump files for appeal, experts say the case likely would go to New York’s Appellate Division, First Department.      It is likely a five-justice panel from the First Department will be randomly selected to hear the appeal, but that won’t happen until after Trump’s lawyers have filed it.      There are 21 judges in the First Department, any of whom could be tapped. This photo shows five of them. Chances are statistically slim those exact five would be picked.","During a May 31 press conference, former President Donald Trump said he plans to appeal his  conviction on 34 felony counts  of falsifying business records.  Even before he announced that intent, however, some people speculated about which justices might hear a Trump appeal.  ""The appeals court,"" one X user  wrote , sharing a photo of five African American women in judicial robes. ""I’m thinking the appeal won’t go well.""  The conservative X account Hodgetwins  reshared that post , echoing the sentiment, ""Trump is screwed on appeal.""  The photo spread beyond conservative accounts.  Liberal commentator and podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen also shared the viral photo of the five justices, though he did not echo the claim that the demographics of the photographed justices would affect the outcome of Trump’s appeal. ""New: Trump’s appeal oral arguments will take place in front of the first all-Black women appellate bench,"" he  wrote  on X May 31. (Screenshots from X.) Claims that the photo shows the justices who will hear Trump’s appeal are inaccurate. Experts told PolitiFact it is impossible to know now which New York justices might hear Trump’s appeal.  Legal experts familiar with New York’s appellate system said that because the case is a Manhattan case, a randomly selected panel of justices from New York’s Appellate Division, First Department would hear Trump’s appeal. The Appellate Division’s First Judicial Department  includes 21 justices of the court, according to its  website. They include 13 women and eight men, all from various racial and ethnic backgrounds.  The five justices in the viral photo — from  left , justices Bahaati Pitt-Burke, Troy K. Webber, Presiding Justice Dianne T. Renwick, Tanya R. Kennedy and Marsha D. Michael — are on the court. But there’s no guarantee these five justices would hear an appeal. A panel of four or five, but most likely five, judges would be selected to hear the case, according to Daniel A. Warshawsky, a professor at New York Law School who worked in the Office of the Appellate Defender for 15 years. ""The panel of judges that will hear and decide Trump’s appeal gets selected after the briefs are in and before oral argument,"" said Sam Feldman, an attorney who specializes in criminal appeals in New York City. ""It’s a random process. There’s no way to know now who will be on that panel.""  Brooklyn Law School professor Cynthia Godsoe agreed with Feldman. The most we can know right now, she said, is that the justices will likely be selected from the pool of First Department justices, unless the case gets moved for some reason — for example, Trump’s team petitions for it to be moved somewhere else. ""It’s just a pure jurisdiction thing,"" Godsoe said. Trump’s legal team ""could file to move it, like they tried to move the trial, but (it’d be) highly unlikely, especially for an appeal,"" she said.  The First Department shared this photo of five judges in a  Feb. 14, 2024, press release  that acknowledged the first time oral arguments before the Appellate Division’s First Department were heard ""by an all African-American bench."" PolitiFact contacted the court and received no response before deadline. The appeals process will likely take time, experts said.  ""After sentencing, his lawyers will file a notice of appeal,"" Feldman said. ""Then the appeal needs to be briefed, which can take many months.""  Trump’s lawyers will file a brief, the prosecution will file a responding brief and then Trump’s lawyers can file a reply, he explained. After that, the case would be scheduled for oral argument. ""In an ordinary case it can take years between sentencing and oral argument in the appeal,"" Feldman said. ""Even if things move quicker in Trump’s case, I would be very surprised if the oral argument occurred before 2025."" Godsoe said that it was probably statistically unlikely that the justices in the viral photo shared by social media users would be the ones randomly selected to hear Trump’s case. With 21 justices, more than 20,000 different five-person panels could be randomly generated, statisticians confirmed to PolitiFact. If they were, however, Godsoe said she knew of no reason they wouldn’t be impartial justices.  There are ethics policies in place that help ensure justices can rule on cases without bias. And there’s nothing inherent in a person’s race or gender that means they will not, Godsoe said: ""White men hear claims by people who are very different from them all the time."" ""If there’s a conflict of interest or even an appearance of impropriety, (justices) could recuse themselves or be required to recuse themselves,"" Godsoe said. That means Trump would get five randomly assigned judges from the First Department, ""but if somehow one of them had a conflict, then they would be off the five and they’d put someone else, randomly, on.""  Social media users shared a photo they said showed the justices who will rule on Trump’s appeal. The group justices who will rule on Trump’s appeal will not be assigned until Trump’s legal team has filed an appeal and briefs have been filed, experts told PolitiFact. It’s possible the justices in the photo would be randomly selected to hear Trump’s appeal, but that has not been determined. They are among 21 people who could be chosen for a four- or five-person panel and chances are statistically slim those exact five would be picked.  Based on what is known May 31, one day after a jury convicted Trump, we rate these claims False.

""I think  she should be in jail  for what she did with her emails."" —  June 2016 rally in Redding, California ,  Clinton said that ""it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.""

""Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and  should be in jail . Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election."" —  October 2016 tweet . Days before the 2016 election,  Trump floated the possibility  of Clinton serving in office while facing charges. ""If she were to win this election, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. In that situation, we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. It would grind government to a halt."" Trump campaigned on a promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton, but he  broke that promise . The closest thing to an investigation of Clinton's emails was  released publicly  in October 2019, but it was actually a probe that began before Trump was elected president. A three-year  investigation  by the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security found that there was no widespread mishandling of classified information.

""I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't,"" Trump told The New York Times in  November 2016 . ""She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, and I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious."" In 2020, Trump reprised the theme of locking up Clinton.

politifact,"Says in his three election campaigns, the early polls were ""wildly incorrect, all three times.""","Polls conducted on Ron Johnson, R-Wis’ Senate runs in 2010, 2016 and 2022 showed him trailing in the early months, especially in 2016, then winning each time.     But polls show the changing dynamics of a campaign, and can’t be used as a predictor until the race’s very last weeks.","It’s not much of a surprise that President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are locked in a close race in battleground Wisconsin. Trump had a 2-point lead among both registered and likely voters in Wisconsin, the latest  Marquette University Law School Poll  found in April.  Other polls released in May showed Biden with a lead in Wisconsin. A  New York Times/Siena College poll  found Biden led in Wisconsin, but not five other battleground states.  In that poll, Biden was up two percentage points among registered voters in Wisconsin. Trump, however, had a 1-point lead among likely voters. A  Quinnipiac poll  showed Biden with a much larger, 6-point lead: 50% to 44% over Trump among registered voters in Wisconsin.  Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., was asked about those Wisconsin polls in a May 19  interview  on NewsNation’s ""The Hill Sunday.""  ""As somebody who has run statewide three times, and seen polls wildly incorrect all three times, I just would not trust the early polls,"" Johnson said. Johnson added there is no doubt that ""Wisconsin is going to be a very close state."" PolitiFact Wisconsin was interested in Johnson’s claim, especially because polls of the Biden-Trump rematch in Wisconsin have shown some variation. First, we will look back at polls during Johnson’s three runs for U.S. Senate to see where they fell. Then, we’ll add some context about what to keep in mind when looking at early polls. When we asked for backup, Johnson spokesperson Kiersten Pels shared a few poll examples, including a poll in which Johnson’s lead was much higher than his final margin and some in which his opponents were polling quite a bit above him, even in the weeks before the election. ""Simply put, the polls were significantly wrong, especially in the last two races. He instinctively knew those races would be close, he ignored the polls, and was proven correct,"" she said. ""The elections were close.""  Since some polls are better than others, let’s look at averages of multiple polls collected by RealClearPolling.com during Johnson’s three U.S. Senate runs – in 2010, 2016 and 2022.  In 2010, Johnson ran against Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold.  According to RealClearPolling’s  averages , Feingold was about 2 percentage points ahead of Johnson in July and August. Then Feingold was up about 1 point through mid-September. After the primary, Johnson pulled ahead of Feingold, polling 6 to 10 percentage points above Feingold for the rest of the race. Johnson  won  that election with 52%, compared with Feingold’s 47%. This election was a rematch of Johnson and Feingold. By that point, Johnson would have had more recognition as an incumbent. S,o if that was a factor in early polls in 2010, it was less so in 2016. Feingold had a lead over Johnson the entire race, according to RealClearPolling’s  averages . Johnson trailed by more than 12 points between April and August of 2015 — which were very early polls. Feingold was still leading by upwards of 10 points for most of the campaign, until it narrowed in the last month or so. Johnson pulled off an upset that year,  winning  with about 50%, compared to Feingold’s 47%. Those  averages  are a little easier to parse. Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes had a 4-to-5 point lead until mid-September.  Around the time of the primary, their leads switched. Johnson stayed about three points ahead of Barnes for the rest of the campaign. Johnson  won  by just a percentage point: 50.5% to Barnes’ 49.5%. To summarize: Polling conducted in the early months of the election cycles did show Johnson trailing, though he won all three elections. That’s most obvious in 2016, when Feingold led essentially the entire time.  But does that mean the early polls are ""wildly incorrect,"" as Johnson said? It’s a little more complicated than that.  Polls are a snapshot in time rather than a predictor, Johnson’s 2016 race is a good example PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, for context.  ""It’s an old line, but polls are a snapshot in time,"" Franklin said. ""A poll really is a measure of where opinion stands at the time that the poll was taken."" Although it’s inevitable that people will look at polls today as a prediction of where the race will end up months from now, that’s not the right way to look at it, he said.  Instead, polls ""capture the dynamics of a campaign,"" he said. Johnson’s run in 2016 is one of Franklin’s favorite examples of that.  ""I think the polling captured the dynamics of that race extremely well, showing Johnson starting out trailing, but showing him running an effective campaign that closed the margin consistently, and ultimately put him in a position to win,"" he said. Polls do get ""better as predictors as you get later in the campaign,"" Franklin said, and especially in the last two or three weeks. But even then, they’re not infallible.  Johnson said he saw early polls that were ""wildly incorrect"" during each of his three statewide runs.  The heart of Johnson's claim is accurate: Polls showed him trailing in the early months, despite pulling off a victory each time. That was most clear in 2016. When Johnson said not to trust the early polls, he wasn’t suggesting there was something wrong with the polling methodology itself. Instead, he’s getting at the idea that his polls didn’t match the final outcome. Still, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the polls were ""wildly incorrect."" Polls aren’t supposed to predict the final election outcome, but show a snapshot of the campaign in time.  Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""

politifact,"“Due to the arrangements that I've reached with (Mexico) President Obrador, the number of migrants coming … to our shared border unlawfully in recent months has dropped dramatically.”",U.S. Border Patrol data shows migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped from December to April.     Immigration experts said it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings. But they acknowledged that Mexico has been intercepting a much higher number of migrants in recent months because of agreements with the U.S. government.,"President Joe Biden issued a new directive June 4 to limit the number of migrants seeking asylum at the southern U.S. border.  Biden’s  proclamation  comes weeks before he and former President Donald Trump face off in their first 2024 presidential debate and as they  battle  over their records on immigration policies.  The Biden administration’s directive suspends and limits the entry of certain noncitizens into the U.S. across the southern border when the Homeland Security secretary determines that there has been an average of 2,500 encounters or more at the border over seven consecutive days. To halt the suspension, the numbers would have to drop to fewer than 1,500 encounters on average seven days in a row.  Encounters data represents events, not people. For example, if one person tries to cross the border three times and is stopped each time, that would be counted as three encounters. This data also doesn’t tell us  how many people stayed in the U.S. The order takes effect immediately because current daily encounters exceed 2,500,  according to the administration . In a speech June 4 at the White House, Biden said the numbers of encounters are dropping already. ""The facts are clear, due to the arrangements that I've reached with (Mexican) President (Andrés Manuel López) Obrador, the number of migrants coming … to our shared border unlawfully in recent months has dropped dramatically,"" Biden said. ""While these steps are important, they're not enough to truly secure the border."" We found that the encounter numbers have dropped in recent months amid increased interceptions by Mexico. But immigration experts told PolitiFact it's difficult to pinpoint one reason for any change in migration numbers.  The White House pointed to the latest publicly available data from the U.S. Border Patrol showing immigration officials encountered people illegally crossing the border about  128,900  times in April compared with about  250,000  in December. That’s a 48.4% decrease. The numbers of encounters at ports of entry have also dropped During a  May 13 news conference , López Obrador said the number of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border had dropped by about 50%. David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato institute, said Biden is correct to attribute border encounter declines to actions by Mexico, but offered a caveat. ""Mexico is making unprecedented arrests,"" Bier said. ""I believe that it is unsustainable because, although Mexico is arresting them and sending them to southern Mexico, they are not deporting them to their home countries. This means that it is very likely they will ultimately find their way to the United States because they are still in Mexico, and there's not much for them to do there except keep trying to get to the U.S."" U.S. officials said Mexico’s willingness to stop migrants from entering the U.S. is largely because of increased dialogue between the two countries. Biden and López Obrador have spoken  multiple   times  since late 2023 and have  released joint statements  over the last several months about joint efforts to curb immigration, fentanyl and firearms trafficking. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also went to Mexico in December to meet with their Mexican counterparts.  ""As we made clear in Mexico City today, we are committed to partnering with Mexico to address our shared challenges, including managing unprecedented irregular migration in the region, reopening key ports of entry, and combating illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs,"" Blinken  wrote Dec. 27 on X . A White House  summary  of a conversation in April between Biden and López Obrador said the two politicians ordered their national security teams to apply measures that would  ""significantly reduce irregular border crossings"" and to address the root causes of the migration. U.S. immigration experts said it’s difficult to isolate single causes for any change in the number of arrivals at the border, but agreed that Mexico vastly increased its enforcement efforts after discussions between the two nations. However, ""there is no reason to think that this drop will be long-lasting, especially considering the number of migrants who are likely stranded in Mexico right now,"" said Adam Isacson, defense oversight director at Washington Office on Latin America, a group advocating for human rights in the Americas.  ""No crackdown in the last 10 years has had a lasting impact, not even Title 42,"" he said. Title 42 is a public health policy invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic to decrease the number of migrants entering the U.S. Whether the declines continue is uncertain, because migrants and migrant smugglers ""have proven highly adaptable to changes in policy, process, operations and even infrastructure,"" said Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser for immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank. ""We have not seen sustained decreases in arrivals after policy changes in the past."" The data also doesn’t reflect the changing demographics and nationalities of people arriving, nor the factors sending them to the border. Continued fluctuation in numbers of arrivals is expected if there is no consistent immigration policy to address the ongoing migration crisis, Brown said. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that  supports low levels of immigration, said it’s hard to say how much Mexico’s actions have contributed to the decline, but that the numbers are still high. ""It is possible their actions matter, but even if they do, we have no idea if Mexico will continue to take action nor do we know if the smugglers and migrants will simply adapt and the modest decline will disappear."" Biden said, ""Due to the arrangements that I've reached with President Obrador, the number of migrants coming … to our shared border unlawfully in recent months has dropped dramatically."" U.S. Border Patrol data shows immigrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped in recent months. Immigration experts said it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings, but acknowledged that the decrease comes amid more cooperation between the two countries.  Biden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Not everyone was let in.     The data reflects the people that the federal government is aware of, but it is not exhaustive.     Experts said despite the data’s limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump’s repeated statements that ""millions"" of immigrants in the country illegally came from jails, prisons or mental institutions.","Former President Donald Trump, who has promised to carry out the ""largest domestic deportation operation"" in U.S. history if reelected, says an enormous number of immigrants entering the country illegally are people with mental illnesses or criminal records. President Joe Biden ""is letting millions of people from jails, from prisons, from insane asylums, from mental institutions, drug dealers pour in,"" Trump  told reporters  May 29 in Manhattan during his falsified business records trial. ""Venezuela, if you look at their crime statistics, they’ve gone down 72% in crime because they’re releasing all their criminals into our country because of this horrible president that we have."" We fact-checked a similar statement by Trump about Venezuela and rated it  False . Here, we will examine Trump’s statement that ""millions"" of immigrants are pouring in from jails and mental institutions — a  frequent  Trump talking point that reporters have  examined   and   debunked   before . Some migrants have criminal records, but we found no evidence that they add up to millions. U.S. Customs and Border Protection  data  shows that from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024, immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions whether in the U.S. or abroad, so long as the conviction was for conduct deemed criminal by the U.S.  Some key points about this number: Includes people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone stopped was let in. The term ""noncitizens"" includes people who may have legal immigration status in the U.S., but are not U.S. citizens. Fiscal year 2021 includes about four months of Trump’s administration; the data for fiscal year 2024 is incomplete. (The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.) The data reflects the numbers the federal government knows about, but it’s inexhaustive. ""A pro-Trump responder would say (correctly) that countries like Venezuela or Cuba don’t share their criminal databases with the US, and other countries' justice systems are in general disarray anyway (Haiti, Honduras etc.),"" border security expert Adam Isacson wrote in an email to PolitiFact.  But Trump’s ""millions"" statement is ""laughable,"" said Isacson, defense oversight director at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy organization. Including repeat crossers, there’ve been around 8 million encounters at the border since Biden took office, Isacson said. For reference, encounters data represents events, not people. For example, if one person tries to cross the border three times and is stopped each time, that would be counted as three encounters. This data also doesn’t tell us  how many people stayed in the U.S.   ""‘Millions’ would mean one in eight was someone released from a jail or a mental institution, a claim too ridiculous to dignify,"" Isacson said. It also ""strains belief,"" he said, that someone with serious mental illness could navigate the route to the U.S. after release from an institution. Mike LaSusa, deputy content director for InSight Crime, a think tank focused on crime and security in the Americas, said that because the U.S. government doesn’t stop everyone who crosses, it’s impossible to know exactly how many criminals may have entered. However, LaSusa said, the claim of ‘millions’ coming from prisons seemed mathematically and logically unlikely. ""The trend in recent years has generally been toward locking more people up, not letting them out so they can emigrate,"" he said. The federal government’s data showed Border Patrol apprehended 2,033 gang members nationwide  from  fiscal years 2021 to 2024 . The  El Paso Times  reported that the Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in Venezuelan prisons, ""has been detected in the El Paso-Juárez borderlands among the continuing arrival of thousands of migrants seeking political asylum."" The article did not say how many were ""detected."" CBP data shows that border officials have apprehended 47 Tren de Aragua gang members during Biden’s presidency.  Under Biden, the U.S. has expelled, removed or returned people out of the U.S. around 3.8 million times, according to  PolitiFact’s March analysis  of  Department of Homeland Security   data . In September 2021, DHS released a  memo  instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prioritize removing people who have crossed the border in recent years or who threaten public safety. Courts halted those guidelines in 2021, but they were  reinstated  in 2023 after a Supreme Court decision. Biden on June 4 announced a  new order  to limit the number of migrants seeking asylum at the border. Pierluigi Mancini , an Atlanta-based expert on immigrant behavioral health, also told PolitiFact that Trump’s statement about emptying facilities of people with mental illness who are coming to the U.S. ""does not make sense because those numbers are not there."" Many people in Latin American countries face barriers to getting mental health treatment, Mancini said, and ""if there are mentally ill persons flooding the United States, they are not coming from psychiatric hospitals.""  Often, people pay smugglers  thousands of dollars  to help them get into the U.S. Also, immigrants usually must wait in Guatemala or Mexico before they try to cross into the U.S. And then they need the physical fortitude to make the journey ""something that someone with a serious mental illness may be unable to,"" Mancini said. We asked the Trump campaign for its evidence and received no reply. But in 2023, the campaign pointed  CNN  to an article a Border Patrol veteran wrote for  Breitbart , a conservative news website. The article was based on information from an unnamed source at Customs and Border Protection and a Homeland Security intelligence report (we did not see the report and PolitiFact does not rely on anonymous information). The article said the report found the Venezuelan government was freeing inmates, including those convicted of rape and murder, and that they were seen traveling to the border, but included no specific numbers. The Trump campaign also cited to  CNN  a 1983  Washington Post  article about criminals who came from Cuba via the Mariel boatlift. The article said that Cuba’s then-leader Fidel Castro put inmates and people with mental illness on the boats and that 22,000 arrivals admitted that they were convicts.  But  reporters who were based in South Florida  then later said that the claims were inflated. Academics and  U.S. federal government researchers   agreed . And Trump’s statement wasn’t about historical migration. Trump said Biden ""is letting millions of people from jails, from prisons, from insane asylums, from mental institutions, drug dealers pour in."" The Trump campaign provided no evidence to support this claim to PolitiFact, and news articles the campaign has previously cited don’t prove that millions of such immigrants are coming into the U.S.  Are there some immigrants with criminal records who try getting into the U.S.? Yes.

But experts on prisons or Congo said that they had no evidence to back up Trump’s statement about people coming from jails and prisons.","A persistent theme of former President Donald Trump’s false immigration rhetoric is that immigrants are pouring across the border after leaving mental institutions, jails or prisons. He has made such claims  broadly about immigrants , and specifically about people from  Venezuela  and  the Democratic Republic of Congo . ""The Congo has just released a lot of people from jail,""  Trump said  May 31 after his New York conviction for falsifying business records. ""Congo, Africa, just released a lot of people, a lot of people from their prisons and jails and brought them into the United States of America."" We found no evidence that Congo’s government releases prisoners and sends them to the United States. We previously also  could not corroborate  the claim about masses of Venezuelan prisoners coming to the U.S. Here we’ll focus on  Trump’s   claims  about people from Congo, something he’s been repeating at least since January. We asked the Trump campaign if he was referring to people who crossed the border legally or illegally and for his evidence that Congolese were coming from jails and prisons to the U.S. In her response, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to  overall  data about illegal immigration including  ""gotaways""  — a term immigration officials use for people who evade U.S. Border Patrol detection.  ""Border Patrol continues to apprehend special interest aliens and terror suspects at the border from countries like the Congo, China, and Afghanistan,"" she said. We’ve found that Customs and Border Protection does not publicly release data on  ""special interest aliens.""  We’ve also  reported  that U.S. immigration officials have encountered rising numbers of people on the terrorist watchlist. But not everyone on the list is a terrorist, and not everyone encountered is allowed to enter the country.   Leavitt also cited a  PBS NewsHour story  that said human traffickers are ""smuggling people from as far away as Congo, India and China."" None of these  sources  said that Congolese were being released from jail or prison and sent to the U.S.  The Democratic Republic of Congo  is the ""big Congo,"" a former Belgian colony that has Kinshasa as its capital, said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, a research and advocacy group.  The Republic of the Congo  is the ""little Congo,"" a former French colony that has Brazzaville as its capital. They are adjacent to each other and separated by the Congo River. The majority of the U.S. Border Patrol encounters are with people from the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2022, increased violence exacerbated insecurity in the Democratic Republic of Congo, internally displacing hundreds of thousands of people, according to the  United Nations Refugee Agency . The agency says more than 6.2 million people are displaced and 1 million have sought asylum, mostly within Africa.  U.S. border officials stopped people from both the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of the Congo more than 2,800 times during the Trump administration and have done so more than 3,700 times during Biden’s administration.  About  12,600 refugees  from the Democratic Republic of Congo arrived in the U.S. from fiscal years 2021 to 2022 (latest figures available). Fiscal year 2021, which ran from Oct. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021, includes a few months of the Trump administration. The numbers of refugees from the Republic of Congo were in the single digits annually for Trump and Biden. Refugees arrive in the U.S. legally and must pass security background checks before being let into the country. Experts on prisons or the Congo said that they had no evidence to back up Trump’s statement about people coming to the U.S. from Congo’s jails and prisons. ""No one in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) is aware of this fact,"" said Abdoulaye Diarra, Amnesty International’s Central Africa researcher. Mudge said, ""We have looked into this on the DRC side and have seen no evidence of this.""  Helen Fair, a World Prison Brief researcher, also said she could not substantiate Trump’s statement. ""I do a daily news search to keep an eye on what’s going on in prisons around the world, and I haven’t seen any news reports of the mass release of people from prisons in Congo, and certainly not that they’ve then been sent to prisons in the US,"" Fair told PolitiFact. Joshua Z. Walker, programs director at the  Congo Research Group  at New York University, said that beginning in late March, approximately 300 prisoners from the main prison in Kinshasa were released. But Walker said he knew of no evidence that the released prisoners went to the U.S.  The Congolese government is facing an insurgency by a Rwanda-backed armed group that is occupying much of the government's attention and resources. ""There is no chance that it would be interested in pursuing the costly, complicated, and risky endeavor of sending former prisoners to illegally enter the U.S,"" Walker said. Trump said ""Congo, Africa, just released a lot of people, a lot of people from their prisons and jails and brought them into the United States of America."" Trump’s comments leave the impression that some official entity in Congo is releasing prisoners and bringing them to the U.S. We found no evidence to back that up. The Trump campaign pointed to overall data on illegal immigration during Biden’s administration and one news article that said human traffickers  brought people from multiple countries including Congo.

The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The post wrongly states that Texas’ constitution would knock Trump off the ballot.  ""The qualifications of federal office are outlined by the U.S. Constitution, not the Texas Constitution,"" Alicia Phillips Pierce, a spokesperson for Texas’ secretary of state, told PolitiFact in an email.  The Texas secretary of state’s website  lists the qualifications for the presidency  and does not  mention criminal history. That’s because it wouldn’t disqualify a candidate from running for the presidency. The U.S. Constitution upholds the principle that voters decide who should represent them, and its  qualifications  are limited to natural-born citizenship, age (35 by Inauguration Day) and residency in the United States (14 years). Texas election code  prohibits anyone who is ""finally convicted of a felony"" from running for office in the state, but that doesn’t cover the U.S. presidency, which is a federal office, said Mimi Marziani, an adjunct professor at University of Texas at Austin law school who has taught constitutional law. ""It does mean that if Trump were finally convicted — after his appeals, etc. — that he would be ineligible to run for, say, Texas Governor,"" said  Marziani,  a lawyer in private practice and former president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit group advocating for voting rights.  Texas election code  states that a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president on the ballot as long as those nominees meet the qualifications ""prescribed by federal law."" Andy Taylor, an election lawyer in Texas who has represented many Texas Republicans, agreed that the claim that Trump’s felony conviction bars him from the ballot is wrong.  ""Trump can and will be on the ballot in Texas,"" Taylor said.

politifact,Says he “saved Kenosha” and the “governor wouldn’t move” on sending the National Guard.,"Protests occurred in a limited area, as we noted in a 2020 fact-check, compared with the entire scope of the city.      Factors besides the National Guard presence decreased violence, including a drop in the number of armed people and calls for peace.      State-level National Guard efforts began before the Trump administration got involved.","In the middle of talking about crime and immigration in his June 18 rally in Racine, Wisconsin, former President Donald Trump turned his attention to Kenosha. Kenosha — about 11 miles south of where Trump held his rally — was rocked by  civil unrest  in 2020 after a police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, seven times. The officer was  not criminally charged . While there was looting, firebombing and violence during  some nights  of the protests, others were peaceful.  ""I saved Kenosha, do you know that?"" Trump  told  the crowd. ""I saved it. Kenosha was about ready to go down the tubes."" ""The governor wouldn’t move, he just wouldn’t move, and I moved,"" he said. ""You know, I’m not supposed to, it’s supposed to be the governor is supposed to do it. The mayor and the governor.""  Trump has made similar claims before: that Kenosha would have been destroyed without him and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers was too late to send help. In 2020,  PolitiFact Wisconsin rated  those claims Pants on Fire.  There were three assumptions, which were also at play in Trump’s latest claims, that we investigated:  In our 2020 fact check, we found each to be wrong. Let’s go through those again. Protests occurred in a limited area compared to entire city  There’s a big difference between protests damaging a limited area and destroying or altering a large portion of a city of 100,000 people, we noted in that fact-check.  The protests, even at the peak of the unrest Aug. 25, 2020, were largely concentrated in the one-acre Civic Park and a nearby area a few blocks wide, though people spilled into nearby neighborhoods after the largest groups were dispersed. That drastically exaggerates the scope of the situation in Kenosha, a city of 28.4 square miles, even at its worst. That goes against Trump’s new statement of the city being ""about ready to go down the tubes.""  Other factors beside National Guard presence reduced violence, including calls for peace In 2020, Trump’s attempt to claim credit assumed the National Guard presence was the only factor in the lack of violence after Kyle Rittenhouse shot three people and killed two. Rittenhouse was  later found  not guilty on five counts, including intentional, reckless and attempted homicide. There were other reasons why violence slowed down after that, including a change in who was in the crowd. A group described by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth as ""a militia"" and ""vigilante group"" had been patrolling the streets of Kenosha and even standing watch on roofs with long guns the first couple of nights after the Blake shooting.  In the hours before the shootings, the ""Kenosha Guard""  issued a call on Facebook for ""patriots willing to take up arms and defend out (sic) City tonight from the evil thugs."" That page was removed by Facebook after the Rittenhouse shooting.  And people wearing military gear and openly carrying weapons decreased drastically after the night of chaos that included the shooting, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters who were on the ground in Kenosha.  Nevertheless, citizens with handguns were observed as late as the weekend. During the height of the protests, the vigilante groups and Black Lives Matter protesters were regularly clashing with one another, by hurling insults or worse.  Removing half of that equation — for whatever reason that occurred — changed the situation dramatically. Besides a drop in armed people, there were also calls for peace, including from Blake’s family, at marches and rallies, and — to varying degrees — from Evers and local officials.  Evers also declared a state of emergency, and local officials took steps to better control the area, such as closing off freeway access. That was in addition to increasing the number of troops, which also happened.  Trump did not send the National Guard, state efforts began before Trump talked to Wisconsin officials   That brings us to the final part of the claim, and something Trump noted again at his rally in Racine: that he was responsible for sending in the National Guard, and Evers didn’t act.  The White House described itself as authorizing 2,000 National Guard troops to go to Kenosha. But Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, who then commanded the Wisconsin National Guard, said that’s not really how that system operates.  He described it this way when asked what role the White House played in the Kenosha response. ""What I want to re-emphasize is the process is actually a governor-to-governor compact,"" Knapp said.  ""Through the (Emergency Management Assistance Compact) process we had already started talking to other states (when the White House got involved), it’s one of the things we do right away during something like this."" Each state has its own National Guard — as provided for in the Constitution — and the guard has a role at both the state and federal level, according to its website.  Governors can call the National Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies. On Aug. 24, 2020, Evers activated the Guard, less than 24 hours after Blake was shot. The Trump administration talked to Evers on Aug. 25, 2020.  The president can also activate the guard for federal missions. Examples of federal missions given on the website included deployments to Kosovo or the anti-terrorism efforts in the Middle East. After the Rittenhouse shooting, Evers increased National Guard troop numbers from 250 to 500. Evers also accepted federal troops from the Trump administration, after  initially turning down  federal help. We noted that in a  related fact-check in 2021 . Evers’ administration said the White House was offering help from the Department of Homeland Security, not the National Guard. Evers had declined because more Guard members had already been sent.  Our ruling At a rally in Racine, Trump made similar claims to ones he said almost four years ago: that he ""saved Kenosha"" and the ""governor wouldn’t move"" on sending the National Guard.  Other factors besides the National Guard’s presence calmed the situation in Kenosha, including calls for peace and a reduction in the number of armed people.  Trump also said Kenosha was ""about ready go down the tubes,"" though protests were largely contained to one acre of the larger city — exaggerating the scope of the situation.  Finally, Trump was not responsible for sending in the National Guard. State-level efforts began before his administration got involved. His administration did send in federal troops, but Evers had activated the National Guard before that.

politifact,Former President Donald Trump is “against mail in voting.”,"Former President Donald Trump frequently spoke negatively, and sometimes falsely, about voting by mail in 2020. He called the practice ""corrupt"" at a February 2024 rally in Michigan.     This year, he has said his goal is ""one-day voting."" But he has also told voters that voting by mail is a good option.     In June, Trump said ""whether you vote early, absentee, by mail, or in person we are going to protect the vote.""","An ad by a liberal group says, ""MAGA patriots listen to our president!"" It includes clips of former President Donald Trump criticizing voting by mail. The Trump clips are authentic and were taken from remarks he made this past February and in 2020. The  ad  concludes with text: ""Stand Strong with President Trump against mail in voting!""  But that’s not what Trump has said this year. On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump has  told Republicans  it is acceptable to vote by mail. But he also said his goal is  ""one-day voting""  which would likely preclude voting by mail. Pennsylvania Values PAC, a  liberal group   opposing Trump , created the ad. The Trump campaign sent a  letter  to the PAC asking it to take the ad down. A report the PAC filed with the Federal Election Commission showed it spent  $44,000 on a digital ad in June . The ad includes three clips of Trump speaking against voting by mail. ""All of the things that are happening with votes by mail, I am not going to say which party does it, but thousands of votes are gathered and they are coming and they are dumped in a location and then all of a sudden you lose elections that you think you are going to win.""  –  April 8, 2020, coronavirus press briefing Trump said that in response to a reporter’s question about his opposition to voting by mail. Trump also said, ""If you're a senior citizen and if you're somebody that needs (mail-in voting), I'm all for it."" At a press briefing the same week, Trump said that with voting by mail, ""you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.""

""There’s fraud, they found them in creeks, they found some with the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket.""  —  Sept. 29, 2020 debate . Trump said that in response to a debate moderator’s question about how confident the public should be that the election would be fair. The moderator said that some mail-in ballots would be counted after Election Day. Trump replied, ""They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud."" Trump said, ""This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen."" We rated his statement about ballots found in creeks as  False . ""Mail-in voting is totally corrupt — get that through your head, it has to be.""  —  Feb. 17 rally  in Michigan. Trump told the crowd the goal ""will be one-day voting "" but also said ""mail-in voting is totally corrupt — get that through your head, it has to be."" In 2023,  Trump recorded a message  for the Republican National Committee’s 2024 early voting campaign. ""Go to bankyourvote.com to sign up and commit to voting early,"" Trump said.  In 2024, Trump has sometimes attacked voting by mail, but recently, he has promoted it. ""We have to get rid of mail-in ballots because once you have mail-in ballots, you have crooked elections,"" Trump said in January after he  won the Iowa caucus . ""These mail-in ballots are treacherous. They’re treacherous. These boxes, these locked boxes, are horrible. Horrible. And we’ll change it, but we have to win the election in order to change it,"" Trump said in  June in Detroit .  Voters can submit mail ballots at ballot drop boxes in multiple states. Despite these caveats, Trump has also invited Republicans to cast mail ballots. ""Absentee voting, early voting, and Election Day voting are all good options. Republicans must make a plan, register, and vote!"" Trump said in April on  Truth Social.  He repeated that in a May  video . In early June, the Trump campaign unveiled the  Swamp the Vote USA  website, which promotes the various options for voting. Trump said in a video message on the website: ""We must use every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats, they are destroying our country. Whether you vote early, absentee, by mail or in person we are going to protect the vote."" He added, ""Many Republicans like to vote on Election Day"" and, ""if you can’t make it, you need to make a plan, register and vote any way possible."" He posted a  similar statement on Truth Social. Trump promoted the website and the various voting options at a  June rally  in Phoenix.  ""Vote early, vote absentee, vote mail-in, vote in person. I don’t care how they vote, just get out and vote,"" Trump said at a  June rally in Philadelphia . Republicans in many states have used voting by mail for years to win elections. After Trump lost in 2020, Republican strategists renewed efforts to promote voting by mail. Republican groups in Pennsylvania  promoted voting by mail this year and  Trump’s son Donald Jr.  recorded a message: ""if you’re working a double shift or family responsibilities prevent you from voting on Election Day Joe Biden wins. Pennsylvania, I need you to join the mail-in voting list today. Visit skipthelinepa.vote."" CBS News  reported that one reason Trump now promotes voting by mail is that advisers showed him data showing they could broaden their outreach to swing voters in battlegrounds if their base was comfortable with early voting. A liberal political action committee’s ad said Trump is ""against mail in voting."" The ad uses video clips of statements Trump made against voting by mail in 2020 and February.  Trump has spoken negatively about voting by mail at times in 2024 and said his goal is to create ""one-day voting.""

politifact,“Under (the Biden) administration we have witnessed the fastest growth of Black-owned small businesses in more than 30 years.”,Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley’s claim was almost identical to a statement the White House made earlier this year.      PolitiFact had ruled that original Biden administration claim as True.     The U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board data reported record levels of Black business ownership in 2021 and 2022.,"As President Joe Biden ramps up efforts to win over Wisconsin voters, one of Milwaukee’s leading Democratic officials lauded the gains Black Americans made under the Biden administration. On May 16, during an event for Vice President Kamala Harris, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley claimed: ""Under (the Biden) administration we have witnessed the fastest growth of black-owned small businesses in more than 30 years."" Let’s dig into the numbers. What Crowley said might have sounded very familiar. Why? In early 2023, Biden spoke of the record numbers of new Black entrepreneurs during campaign speeches Jan. 27  in South Carolina  and Feb. 4  in Las Vegas . The White House even released a  factsheet  discussing similar claims Feb. 6.  Here’s what the fact sheet laid out: Since the President entered office, a record 16 million new business applications have been filed, and the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled. Building on this momentum, the Biden-Harris Administration has:  Achieved the fastest creation rate of Black-owned businesses in more than 30 years — and more than doubled the share of Black business owners from 2019 to 2022. PolitiFact National did an  earlier fact-check  on the Biden administration’s statements on Black entrepreneurs from the fact sheet and rated it True.  Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board datasets found record levels of Black business ownership in 2021 and 2022. Independent analyses say that some of Biden’s policies likely played a role. PolitiFact  cited a  Brookings Institution  analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s  Annual Business Survey  that showed the number of Black-owned businesses with more than one employee has increased every year since 2017. In the same fact-check, PolitiFact cited the Federal Reserve’s  Survey of Consumer Finances  from 2022. It reported that 11% of Black households held equity in a business. When PolitiFact contacted the Biden administration for comment for its fact-check, the White House ""shared independent analyses suggesting that some Biden policies helped spur these increases."" The analyses in question focused on  changes the Biden administration made  to a pandemic-era initiative, the Paycheck Protection Program, which lent money to small businesses that needed it. On May 16, Crowley said: ""Under (the Biden) administration we have witnessed the fastest growth of black-owned small businesses in more than 30 years.""

politifact,"“The weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war to fend off the Russian invasion are the weapons that Donald Trump sent, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden had refused to send.”","The Obama administration in 2014 rejected Ukraine’s request for lethal aid.     The Trump administration in 2018 approved a plan to sell Javelin missiles to Ukraine.     The Biden administration has approved billions of dollars in assistance to Ukraine, including Javelins.","Former President Donald Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""the greatest salesman"" who repeatedly gets billions of dollars from the United States. ""It never ends,""  Trump said  at a June 15 campaign rally in Michigan. On June 16 on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" host Jake Tapper  asked  Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., about Trump’s recent comments on Ukraine.  Cotton praised Trump’s position on Ukraine and criticized Democrats.  ""The weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war to fend off the Russian invasion are the weapons that Donald Trump sent, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden had refused to send,"" Cotton said. Cotton spokesperson Patrick McCann told PolitiFact that Cotton was referring to Javelins, antiarmor missiles provided by the Trump administration. In 2014, Obama rejected a request by Ukraine for those weapons. Biden was Obama’s vice president. Trump reversed Obama’s policy; in 2018, the Trump administration approved a plan to  sell Ukraine Javelin missiles for $47 million . ""As you can see, it is clear that this form of lethal aid was both important and provided by the Trump administration and not the Obama-Biden one,"" McCann said. However, Cotton’s comments don’t tell the full story about military aid to Ukraine under Obama, Trump and Biden.  Cotton’s ""comment is correct in the sense that Obama never approved transfer of lethal weaponry but Trump did,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, senior fellow in the foreign policy program of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""I would not implicate Biden heavily in the policy of the Obama years; he was just one voice at the table then. He did far more than his former boss ever did for Ukraine, and far more (from February 2022 onward) than Trump ever did, either."" As the president during Russia’s invasion,  Biden  has signed off on Ukrainian aid that included Javelins. Experts on Ukraine military assistance said that the Obama administration rejected Ukraine’s 2014 request for  lethal aid . The decision came as Russian forces invaded the eastern territory of Crimea in 2014 and pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych  fled Ukraine . U.S. officials  were concerned  that providing Javelins to Ukraine would escalate their conflict with Russia.  ""In this sense, Cotton’s claim has some truth to it,"" said Brendan Green, associate professor at the University of Cincinnati's School of Public and International Affairs. However, Obama’s White House  approved other aid . In total, from 2014 to 2016, the United States committed  more than $600 million  in security assistance to Ukraine. Under Obama, the federal government started the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which sent other kinds of U.S. military equipment to the country. From federal fiscal years 2016 to 2019, which overlap with Obama and Trump, Congress appropriated  $850 million . Trump also withheld aid when trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. During a July 2019  phone call , Zelenskyy told Trump he was almost ready to buy more Javelins from the U.S. Trump replied by asking for ""a favor,"" which was to collect dirt on Biden, a potential 2020 presidential race opponent at the time.  In January 2020, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office  concluded  that Trump abused his power by telling Zelenskyy the U.S. would provide Ukraine with security assistance and he would grant Zelenskyy a White House meeting only if Zelenskyy announced investigations into Trump’s political rivals. The House impeached Trump for this matter in 2019; the Senate acquitted him in 2020. Cotton said that Trump provided ""the weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war."" Russia’s invasion started in February 2022 when Biden was president. During the Biden administration, the U.S. has provided extensive military aid to Ukraine, including weapons. Some of that military aid was sent before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and some followed the invasion. Every new president inherits the spending that was approved under the previous president. In Biden’s case, when he took office in January 2021, he was working with the last spending approved by Trump; this ran through September 2021.  But the Biden administration went beyond this Trump-enacted spending and used the Presidential Drawdown Authority to send aid to Ukraine multiple times. That authority allows the president to provide military assistance during crisis situations. The State Department secretary exercised authority delegated by the president to direct 44 ""drawdowns"" since August 2021, according to a  June statement from the department . In March 2021, the Defense Department announced a  $125 million package  for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative that included equipment. On Sept. 1, 2021 the federal government announced a new  $60 million security assistance package .  A  Congressional Research Service report  said that in federal fiscal year 2021, State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development allocations to Ukraine totaled about $464 million, including $115 million in the Foreign Military Financing program.  In January 2022, Biden authorized the State Department to allow transfer of  U.S.-provided equipment already in the hands of allies,  Defense One reported  based on information it received from the National Security Council. The State Department in January 2022 also cleared three NATO allies to rush antiarmor missiles and other U.S.-made weapons to Ukraine,  Politico reported . The Biden administration also began shipping $200 million worth of antiarmor missiles, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, Politico wrote. In February 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden authorized $350 million of military assistance from Defense Department inventories, including antiarmor, small arms, munitions and body armor. It was the third time Biden expedited emergency security assistance for Ukraine’s defense in the months leading up to the invasion using the Presidential Drawdown Authority, the  Defense Department  said.   We  wrote after the war’s first year  that Congress had approved four separate measures that allocated money to benefit Ukraine, totaling $113 billion. About $50 billion was for direct military aid. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, said that the aid to Ukraine since 2022 ""has included all of the really significant lethal weapon systems sent by the U.S., including artillery, anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and rocket systems. And much of that aid was opposed by Republicans in Congress and by former President Trump."" Ultimately, both the Trump and Biden administrations sent Ukraine ""weapon systems that helped during the 2022 invasion,"" Janda said. Steven Pifer, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 1998 to 2000, agreed that Cotton has a point that the Obama administration did not provide the Javelin antiarmor missiles to Ukraine and that the Trump administration provided a limited number of Javelin missiles. ""However, he is incorrect as regards the Biden administration,"" Pifer said, noting Biden’s provision of sophisticated weapons including rocket systems, fighting vehicles and missiles. ""Since the war, Biden has sent the Ukrainians just about everything and the kitchen sink,"" Green said. Cotton said, ""The weapons that Ukraine used in the early days of this war to fend off the Russian invasion are the weapons that Donald Trump sent, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden had refused to send."" The Obama administration in 2014, while Biden was vice president, did reject Ukraine’s request for lethal Javelin missiles, although it supplied other aid. Trump reversed that policy and approved a plan to sell Javelins.  Cotton stretches this claim by tying Obama’s policy to Biden, who as president has built on Trump’s assistance and more. Biden’s administration shipped $200 million worth of antiarmor missiles, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine before Russia’s invasion. The Biden administration also authorized $350 million of military assistance from Defense Department inventories, including antiarmor, small arms, munitions and body armor immediately after the invasion.

politifact,“Deadlines have passed in … Wisconsin” to replace President Joe Biden on the ballot.,"Presidential and vice presidential candidates are placed on the ballot once parties certify their names to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.      The deadline for the parties to do so is Sept. 3, which has not passed.      That date is after the Democratic National Convention, and Democrats plan to nominate Biden even before the convention.","Speculation — and misinformation — has surrounded what could happen if President Joe Biden decides to exit the presidential race, though he has  declared he’ll keep running .  That includes multiple posts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that the deadline to replace Biden on the ballot has passed in Wisconsin.  ""I’ve been telling you for days. Deadlines have passed in Nevada and Wisconsin and Republicans are absolutely willing to fight to keep any replacement nominee/ticket off,"" a now-deleted post read.  The conservative Heritage Foundation  indicated  they were eyeing legal challenges in states with deadlines they believed posed obstacles to replacing Biden. Wisconsin, Georgia and Nevada were included.  Other posts, including  one  from July 8, show social media users believe ""Democrats missed the deadline to remove Biden off the ballot in certain states like Wisconsin, Georgia or Nevada.""  At PolitiFact Wisconsin, we’re focusing just on the Wisconsin part of the claim.  Has the deadline in Wisconsin to replace Biden on the top of the ticket passed? Let’s take a look.  When asked about the deadline in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Elections Commission directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the commission’s  memo  about ballot access requirements for presidential and vice presidential candidates.   In Wisconsin, the parties that have attained ballot access are currently the Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green and Constitution parties.  ""The names of candidates for President and Vice President for these parties are placed on the General Election ballot when their names are certified by the state or national chairperson to the Wisconsin Election Commission no later than 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, September 3, 2024, the WEC memo reads.  Each certified candidate also must file a Declaration of Candidacy with the commission by that same deadline. So, the key date here is Sept. 3. That’s the deadline for the Democratic party to certify their candidates’ names to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, and when their names will go on the ballot.  And a few weeks later, Sept. 19 is the deadline for local clerks to send absentee ballots to voters with requests on file — ballots that will have the parties’ presidential and vice presidential nominees at the top. So, it’s less about replacing Biden — he hasn’t even formally been placed on the November ballot yet in Wisconsin. There’s another date to keep in mind, and that’s the timing of the Democratic National Convention. The DNC runs from Aug. 19 to 22 — wrapping up a little less than two weeks before Wisconsin’s deadline.  And the DNC plans to nominate Biden virtually  ahead of the convention  because of an earlier deadline in Ohio law.  If there were an  open convention  and Democrats choose another nominee like Vice President Kamala Harris, the convention is still scheduled to end before Wisconsin’s deadline. So, as long as Democrats certify their candidates to the Wisconsin Election Commission by Sept. 3, whoever those names are will be on the ballot.  Another claim that’s been circulating is that the only way to replace Biden on the ballot is if he dies.  We’ve already said the deadline is Sept. 3, but there is a provision in state law that lays out what would happen in that scenario. ""If a vacancy occurs after nomination due to the death of a candidate of a recognized political party for a partisan office, the vacancy may be filled by the chairperson of the committee of the proper political party,""  state law says .  That state law would likely apply to federal races like president or vice president, but could be subject to litigation or challenges because it hasn’t been used before.

politifact,"In 2020, “only nine NATO allies were spending 2%” of their GDP on defense. “This year, 23 will spend at least 2%.”","In response to instability in the Middle East and Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, NATO leaders agreed in 2014 to aim to commit 2% of their GDP to defense spending by 2024.     In 2020, nine NATO members spent at least 2% of their annual gross domestic product on defense, according to NATO data. In 2024, 23 NATO members will spend at least 2% of their GDP to build up their defenses, recent NATO data shows.     Experts warned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause or president, though multiple experts linked Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to the recent uptick in defense spending.","During an address on the 75th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Alliance, President Joe Biden said that NATO allies have increased their defense spending.  ""In the year 2020 … the year I was elected president, only nine NATO allies were spending 2% of their defense — GDP on defense,""  Biden said . ""This year, 23 will spend at least 2%. And some will spend more than that."" A White House spokesperson cited NATO’s most recent data, which supports Biden’s claim.  In 2024, 23 of  32 NATO members  will spend at least 2% of their annual gross domestic product to build up their defenses,  June 2024 NATO data  shows. That same report said nine allies met the defense spending goal in 2020. Experts said NATO’s data supports Biden’s statement but cautioned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause — or president.  The NATO-provided spending figures for 2023 and 2024 were estimates, not finalized numbers, the organization said. We contacted NATO for clarification and received no response before publication. Typically, NATO data older than two years is final, but the previous and current year’s numbers are estimates, said Julie Garey, an associate teaching professor of political science at Northeastern University.  Those figures are based on the information those countries provide — not all NATO members have the same fiscal year and not all of the countries have implemented their scheduled spending, experts said. NATO asks members for defense spending information once a year and then publishes updates accordingly, ""but not everything a state counts as ‘defense expenditures’ is included in NATO’s measure of spending,"" Garey said. In 2014  — in response to instability in the Middle East and Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea — NATO leaders agreed to commit 2% of their national gross domestic product to defense spending.  That agreement was a nonbinding goal that NATO countries  planned to achieve  ""within a decade."" The idea is that by spending at least 2% of a country’s GDP on defense, the allies will meet their own defense needs and be able to contribute to collective NATO action, Garey said. But there are no explicit  consequences  for a country that fails to meet NATO’s 2% of GDP defense spending goal.  ""I can never emphasize enough that this is money being spent on each state’s defense — it’s not going directly to the alliance,"" she said. ""This is money that countries are spending on their own soldiers, equipment, and so forth, that they own and control and can use as they deem appropriate.""  Countries that haven’t met the target might face pressure from allies to do more, but she said the 2% goal isn’t meant to be a reward or punishment system. Experts said there are too many factors to attribute the rising number of countries meeting the 2% benchmark to one cause. The uptick in NATO countries working to increase their defense spending predates both Biden and former President Donald Trump.  The key factor driving NATO members’ increased defense spending in 2023 and 2024 is ""a European sense of insecurity after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"" said Alexandra Chinchilla, assistant professor of international affairs at the Bush School of Government & Public Service at Texas A&M University.  Countries such as Latvia have required 2% military spending by law, said Anessa Kimball, a political science professor at Laval University and co-director of the Canadian Defence and Security Network. Other countries have been ""more creative in ‘what counts’ as defense spending,"" Kimball said. For example, Belgium counts railways as part of national defense. Greece counts spending on veterans’ pensions.  Some NATO members are likely thinking ""about what a Europe post-NATO might look like"" and what each country might need to prepare if the U.S. left the alliance, Garey said. Trump, who is running for reelection in 2024, has  repeatedly   threatened  to leave NATO.  Biden said that in 2020, ""only nine NATO allies were spending 2%"" of their GDP on defense, and in 2024 ""23 will spend at least 2%.""  June 2024 NATO data supports his claim. NATO’s 2023 and 2024 figures are considered estimates, because not all NATO members have the same fiscal year and not all of the countries have implemented their scheduled spending. The numbers are typically finalized within two years. It's also worth clarifying that countries count ""defense spending"" differently, with some classifying money spent on things such as railways and veterans' pensions.  Experts warned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause or president, though multiple experts linked Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to the recent uptick in defense spending.

Hundreds of homes and farms were bulldozed, and over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn.""","The Trump administration didn’t give taxpayer money to Foxconn — Wisconsin did.     Somewhere between 100 and 130 properties were demolished for the project — not ""hundreds.""     Yes, more than $500 million was spent, but officials say it also helped lead to a massive new investment by Microsoft Corp.","As the presidential race rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump heats up, the Biden campaign is tying Trump to Wisconsin’s infamous Foxconn deal. ""The Trump administration handed out taxpayer dollars to a foreign company. Hundreds of homes and farms were bulldozed, and over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn,"" the Biden-Harris  campaign said  in a May 16  news release . The statement was made a little more than a week after Biden was at Gateway Technical College’s Integrated Manufacturing and Engineering Technology Center in Racine County, along with  Microsoft President Brad Smith  and Gov. Tony Evers to announce a $3.3 billion Microsoft data center.  Biden, the  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  reported, said the Microsoft Corp. development is a ""comeback story,"" playing out across Wisconsin and the nation. The president said the Microsoft plan stands in contrast to the 2017 efforts of Trump and state Republican officials that brought bring Foxconn to Mount Pleasant.  Microsoft is building its data center on land that Foxconn was initially expected to use for a $10 billion LCD manufacturing plant that Trump touted as the ""eighth wonder of the world."" But the investment did not fully happen and neither did the 13,000 jobs Foxconn initially promised. ""Foxconn turned out to be just that,""  Biden said at Gateway . ""A con."" When we asked the Biden campaign to back up the claim, the campaign essentially restated what was originally said. That’s rhetoric, not evidence. Since so much has been written about Foxconn, we started with reports and news accounts. The answer to this is a swift ""no.""  The original 2017 Foxconn deal called for Wisconsin to provide the company with nearly $3 billion in tax credits if it created 13,000 jobs at a $10 billion state-of-the-art factory for producing liquid crystal displays — flat screens used in televisions and other electronics. However, the company scaled back its plans and under Evers, the incentive package was changed to reflect the smaller scope. In 2021, the tax credits were slashed from $2.85 billion to $80 million. The job benchmark fell from 13,000 statewide to 1,454.  And the number for Foxconn’s capital investment went from $10 billion to $672.8 million.  In any case, it was state money — not federal money — that was granted to the company. However, then-President Trump was certainly center stage in June 2018, along with then-Gov. Scott Walker, then-U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Foxconn Chair Terry Gou, all wielding gold-colored shovels at the groundbreaking ceremony for the  Foxconn Technology Group  facility in Mount Pleasant. Were ""hundreds of homes and farms"" bulldozed? Although hundreds of residents were moved out to clear the way for the Foxconn campus, the number of homes and farms has been variously put at between 100 and 132 by different media reports.  A Mount Pleasant village spokesperson said officials worked to secure voluntary agreements with owners of about 130 parcels. But other owners said the village threatened eminent domain, claiming their properties were needed for road improvements.   According to a 2019 report, the Village of Mount Pleasant by June of that year had paid just over $152 million for 132 properties to clear the way for Foxconn, plus an additional $7.9 million in relocation costs, according to village records obtained by  Wisconsin Public Radio and analyzed by Wisconsin Watch .  So, the claim’s second part is somewhat off the mark, in that it referred to homes being bulldozed, when it would have been more accurate to say hundreds of residents relocated. When the Biden campaign responded to us, their quote cited ""hundreds of residents,"" not homes. According to the  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Wisconsin taxpayers were on the hook for at least $583 million preparing for the Foxconn project. If you add in the $257 million from the pockets of American Transmission Company’s Wisconsin electric ratepayers — for new lines and a substation — the total rises to $840 million. But was that money wasted?  Mount Pleasant Community Development Director Sam Schultz said the village's investment in the industrial park, when it was created for Foxconn, helped attract Microsoft and made it possible to move quickly after the company began to buy land, according to a May 14  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  article. ""We benefited from the work that had been done before, the ability to start to acquire large amounts of land and things like a (electrical) substation that exists there already,"" he said.  So, saying that ""$500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn"" is a bit muddy at best. Biden claimed ""The Trump administration handed out taxpayer dollars to a foreign company. Hundreds of homes and farms were bulldozed, and over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn.""  The claim’s first part is off. The Trump administration didn’t pay — state and local taxpayers did. The second part is an overreach — in terms of houses, the number is between 100 and 130, though there may have been hundreds of residents living in those homes.  Finally, although it’s true that more than $500 million was spent on preparing for Foxconn, local officials say the preparation that went into Foxconn is now being put to use for the Microsoft development.  Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  That fits here.  ",half-true,Joe Biden,2024-05-16,2024-07-13,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/biden_harris/d5a42f57181035542bcc344660763828.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jul/13/joe-biden/biden-campaign-hits-and-misses-with-trump-and-foxc/,"National, Corporations, Economy, Elections, Taxes, Wisconsin, Joe Biden"

politifact,“The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of.”,"Examples of political violence against U.S. presidents date back to Abraham Lincoln in 1865.      Lawmakers, presidents and political candidates have also been targeted. U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., was injured in a 2011 shooting and Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., was injured in a 2017 shooting.     The Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol is an example of political violence on a wider scale. Some rioters chanted to ""hang"" Vice President Mike Pence.","As law enforcement  investigates  an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, his political opponent President Joe Biden condemned the violence and characterized it as outside the norm. ""The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of. It was just not appropriate. And we — everybody — everybody must condemn it. Everybody,"" Biden said in a  statement  after the July 13 shooting. Law enforcement identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, as the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally shooting suspect.  Corey Comperatore , a former volunteer fire chief from the area, was killed and two others were critically injured. Neither the White House nor Biden’s campaign provided evidence to back Biden’s statement that this kind of violence is ""unheard of"" in the U.S. The comment ignores that U.S. history shows numerous occasions during which political leaders were targeted by politically-motivated violence, including in recent years. Although it has been  decades  since an armed person attacked a U.S. president, there have been several assassination attempts throughout modern history. In 2005, a  man threw a grenade at President George W. Bush  when he was attending a rally in Tbilisi, Georgia, with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili. In 1981, President  Ronald Reagan  was injured in an assassination attempt, suffering an injured arm, broken rib, punctured lung and serious internal bleeding. Recent  attacks on individual members of Congress  and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol qualify as political violence.  ""The assassination attempt against Trump was in no way unprecedented,"" Rachel Kleinfeld, senior fellow in the democracy, conflict and governance program at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, told PolitiFact in an email. ""In fact, in the current climate of heightened threat and rhetoric, it was almost inevitable that a federal political candidate would be attacked.""  Biden’s  remarks the next day  acknowledged past political violence. ""We must not go down this road in America,"" Biden said. ""We’ve traveled it before throughout our history.  Violence has never been the answer, whether it’s with members of Congress in both parties being targeted in the shot, or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6th, or a brutal attack on the spouse of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, or information and intimidation on election officials, or the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor, or an attempted assassination on Donald Trump. There is no place in America for this kind of violence or for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.""  News that a former president with Secret Service protection faced a life-threatening, violent attack shocked many Americans. But multiple experts on gun violence and political violence noted that the U.S. has a long history of political violence against presidents, political candidates and Congressional members. Javed Ali, a University of Michigan associate professor of practice who previously worked for the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, said July 14 in an email to PolitiFact that the motivations of the now-deceased suspected shooter remained unclear, but it was ""the latest in a long line of similar events in U.S. history."" Political violence directed at U.S. presidents began with Abraham Lincoln in 1865, followed by James Garfield in 1881, William McKinley in 1901 and John F. Kennedy in 1963, each of whom died after being shot. President Gerald Ford escaped uninjured from two 1975 attempts. Gov. George Wallace survived a shooting in 1972 while running for president. In 1981, Reagan was injured. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., was murdered in June 1968 while campaigning for the presidency. All were shootings or attempted shootings.  Two historians  documented other examples of candidates or political leaders who faced assassination attempts. The attack on Trump appears to fit a lone shooter ""pattern of politically-motivated violence, which also has been demonstrated against members of Congress in June 2017, when Rep. Steve Scalise was shot and wounded,"" Ali said of the Louisiana Republican. Some experts, including Kleinfeld, also pointed to several examples of political violence directed at groups — particularly communities of color — and prominent political and social justice leaders. ""America has a long history of episodic political violence, from violence against Catholics and immigrants by the Know Nothing party in the early 1800s, to the blood-soaked Kansas-Missouri borderlands in the abolitionist and slave fights of the 1850s, the Civil War, and then the fight against civil rights 1950s to 1960s,"" Kleinfeld said. She added that from 1963 to 1968 alone, assassins killed Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., and both John F. and Robert Kennedy. Threats against members of Congress and federal judges have also increased, Kleinfeld said, and  local and state officials  have also faced threats. When  Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., in 2022  said threats of political violence had increased against election officials, judges and lawmakers, we rated her claim  Mostly True . We found that U.S. Capitol Police data showed that threats against members of Congress rose from 902 in 2016 to 9,625 in 2021, a roughly tenfold increase, before declining modestly in 2022.  Data  released by the Capitol Police in January 2024 showed 7,501 cases in 2022 and 8,008 cases in 2023. Members of Congress from both political parties face a wide range of threats through mail, email, telephone, social media and the internet, Capitol Police said. Earlier this year, in anticipating the campaign season, Capitol Police Assistant Chief of Protective and Intelligence Operations Ashan M. Benedict signaled a focus on the agency’s  ""expanding mission""   to keep members of Congress safe.   Sam Oliker-Friedland, executive director at the Institute for Responsive Government,  a group that  works to make government and elections more accessible, said, ""Political violence has been a troubling, consistent issue, less driven by idealogues executing a strategy than troubled people with access to guns who read the news. And from the reporting I'm reading today, this fits that pattern.""  Threats against election officials have drawn less attention. In July, a judge  sentenced Andrew Nickels,  an Indiana man, to 14 months in prison after he left a voicemail threatening the life of Rochester Hills, Michigan, Clerk Tina Barton after the 2020 election.  ""Any move toward violence scares me the most for the dedicated public servants who often have many fewer resources than a presidential campaign,"" Oliker-Friedland said. Here are some high-profile political violence incidents over the past 15 years: U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. : On Jan. 8, 2011, Giffords was shot in the head while meeting with constituents at a ""Congress on your corner"" event in a supermarket parking lot in Casas Adobes, Arizona. Giffords was the target of an assassination attempt and was seriously wounded. According to news reports,  Jared Lee Loughner  became fixated on Giffords several years before the shooting. Loughner first met Giffords in 2007 at a community event where he asked her a question and was ""unsatisfied with her answer,"" CNN reported. Loughner was  sentenced  in 2012 to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for the shooting that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R- La. : On June 14, 2017, Scalise, then the House majority whip, and four others were  wounded  when James Hodgkinson shot at them during their baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia. Hodgkinson, who was angry with Trump and posted rants about Republicans online, was killed by police. Authorities reported he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Paul Pelosi : On Oct. 28, 2022, Pelosi, the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was attacked in the couple’s San Francisco home by an intruder. David DePape, who intended to kidnap Nancy Pelosi, struck Paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer. DePape was  sentenced  in May to 30 years in prison following his conviction on assault and attempted kidnapping charges.  U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas' son, Daniel Anderl : On July 19, 2020, Anderl was fatally shot by a lawyer posing as a delivery driver at the judge’s New Jersey home, and her husband Mark was injured.  Roy Den Hollander , the shooter, shot himself and died.News reports said Hollander described himself as an ""anti-feminist"" lawyer and targeted the judge. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer : In October 2020, law enforcement  announced  that multiple people were arrested and charged with conspiring to kidnap Whitmer, a Democrat. Multiple people were convicted in state and federal court. U.S. Capitol : More than 1,400 defendants have been charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, as lawmakers inside sought to certify the 2020 election results.  Some of the defendants carried weapons . Some rioters threatened the then-vice president, chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence!""  Biden said, ""The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of.""

Social media posts are sharing what  they claim  is a first-person account of one Secret Service sniper who says he was told to withhold his fire.  ""Explosive revelation: Jonathan Willis, the officer in this photo from Trump’s rally, claims he had the shooter in his sights for 3 minutes but was ordered not to take the shot by top Secret Service brass,"" one  July 14 Instagram post  read.

The 4chan post included a photo of two snipers on a roof, one wearing a vest with the word ""police"" visible on the back.  The photo appears to be an  Associated Press image  taken at the rally. We contacted The Associated Press to see if it had more information about the identities of the men in the photo and received no reply. Zooming in on the photo shows that the vest of the sniper in the foreground says ""United States Secret Service.""

A reverse-image search using Google Images found that an Associated Press photographer took  the photo  in 2022 at Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Virginia. A July 16  Threads post  shared another photo that claimed to show Trump golfing after the shooting. But this photo appeared to originate from a  YouTube video  posted 10 days before the shooting. A shooter opened fire on Trump’s July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in what the FBI is investigating as an assassination attempt. Trump  said  a bullet hit the upper part of his right ear before he was escorted offstage and  taken to a local hospital  for treatment. One person in the audience was killed and two others were injured. The Secret Service  said  its snipers killed the gunman. That night, Trump traveled to his home at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. On July 14, Trump  posted on Truth Social  that he would leave at 3:30 p.m. for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Claims about Trump golfing following the shooting surfaced after Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in a July 14  X post  shared — and later  retracted  — a video that he said showed Trump went golfing ""the next day"" after the shooting. It was tagged with a community note that said the video was not filmed that day, July 14.

politifact,"“Just last week, Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.”","House Republicans passed a bill in July that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections.      Most Democrats voted against the bill. Federal law for decades has already banned noncitizen voting in federal elections.      Noncitizen voting is statistically rare, but some Republicans have made it a campaign issue in 2024.","Kari Lake, a U.S. Senate candidate from Arizona, joined the chorus of oft-repeated falsehoods this year about noncitizen voting during her speech at the Republican National Convention. ""Just last week, Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election,"" Lake said on the second night of the convention in Milwaukee. Gallego, a Democratic U.S. representative, and Lake are expected to face each other in the U.S. Senate race. The Arizona primary is July 30. Lake’s statement is a distortion of Gallego’s position. Lake referred to the  Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act , which passed the House by a 221-198 vote July 10, largely with Republican support. It’s not expected to pass the Democratic-led Senate. Gallego joined nearly all Democrats in voting against the legislation. This bill,  supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La ., requires people to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. By opposing the bill, Gallego is not voting to allow immigrants who crossed the border illegally to vote in the federal election in November. When Gallego voted against the bill, he said in a  statement , ""Of course only U.S. citizens should vote."" Gallego said the bill would create obstacles for Arizonans to vote because of the requirements to provide the documentary proof of citizenship. In 1996, Congress banned voting by noncitizens, which includes people legally and illegally in the U.S., in federal elections. ""It is already illegal for noncitizens to register or vote in federal elections,"" Wendy Weiser, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU school of law, said in an email to PolitiFact. ""The SAVE Act would not change that fact."" In June, Gallego introduced the  Voting Clarity Act , which would require Customs and Border Protection officers to advise migrants seeking asylum that they are ineligible to vote in federal elections.  Voting in federal elections by noncitizens ""is already a crime several times over,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of voting rights at the  Brennan Center  in a  June statement . Noncitizens who vote face deportation or jail time. When people register to vote, they attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens.  The SAVE Act’s documentary proof of citizenship requirement would call for essentially a birth certificate or a passport to register. ""Our  research  shows that over 9% of adult American citizens don't have those documents readily available,"" Morales-Doyle said. ""So, rather than ‘safeguard American voter eligibility,’ the bill would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. And the impact would be felt disproportionately by citizens of color."" The  Bipartisan Policy Center  concluded that the SAVE Act, proposed months before the presidential election, needs more time and resources to be applied well. Some cities let certain noncitizens vote in local elections. In May, Gallego voted against allowing noncitizens to vote in Washington, D.C., local elections, a reversal of a position a year ago, the  Arizona Republic  and  Cronkite News  found. Former President Donald Trump , some Republican lawmakers and  social media influencers  have spread false and misleading statements about noncitizen voting.  Think tanks,   academics ,  courts  and  journalists  have  analyzed  claims about noncitizen voting for  years  and have found only  sporadic cases  that wouldn’t swing federal elections. Lake said, ""Just last week, Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election."" In July, Gallego voted against the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which requires people to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections.

But by the time Stewart was addressing his viewers about the canceled trip, there were no stated changes to the perimeters.      The Marcus Center, where he was set to host his show, was not, and still is not, in the security ""hard zone"" as Stewart claimed.","Comedian and late-night show host Jon Stewart  was set to bring his popular program , ""The Daily Show,"" to Milwaukee this week during the 2024 Republican National Convention.  That plan changed when former President Donald Trump, this year’s Republican nominee for president,  was shot in the ear  at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania in an attempted assassination. The next day, ""The Daily Show'' sent emails to ticketholders  letting them know the show was off  ""due to logistical issues and the evolving situation in Milwaukee.""  Stewart  opened his July 16 show  by explaining to viewers why he wasn’t in Milwaukee as planned.  Because of the attempt on Trump’s life, Stewart said, the Marcus Performing Arts Center — where they were supposed to host the show — ""was originally located in the ‘soft perimeter,’ they called it, security-wise"" but ""was shifted, understandably so, to the ‘hard perimeter.’""  ""You really don’t want to be in the ‘hard perimeter,’"" he joked afterward, adding that because of the security measures around the theater, his team felt they couldn’t put on their shows effectively.  But his explanation of those perimeters wasn’t quite right. The boundaries of the perimeter did not change following the assassination attempt, and the Marcus Center isn’t in the hard security zone.  Let’s take a look at the details.  So, where exactly is the ""hard zone,"" known as such because it requires credentials to enter?  It surrounds Fiserv Forum, the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center, the main spaces where the convention will take place.  It stretches  from West McKinley Avenue on the north to just past West Wisconsin Avenue to the south, encompasses Pere Marquette Park on the east side and stretches past North Lovell Street on the west.  A wider security footprint, which pedestrians can enter freely but vehicles must enter through a security checkpoint, stretches from the Milwaukee River past North 9th Street and from West Clybourn Street to West Cherry Street.  The Marcus Center is on North Water Street, on the other side of the Milwaukee River. Its box office is open by phone only during the week, and ticketing windows are closed, communications and media relations manager Jennifer Han  told the Journal Sentinel . Its parking structure is open for parking during the RNC, but is accessible only from Water Street or Edison Street because of a security checkpoint on State Street.  Although it made some adjustments to accommodate for security, Han confirmed July 17 that the Marcus Center is not within the security perimeter of the convention. Although Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said July 15 that the agency  had ""strengthened"" its security plan  for the convention following the attempt on Trump’s life, no specific changes to the security zone were announced.  Han did say that at the time ""The Daily Show"" decided to cancel, ""there were still questions"" about whether the security perimeter would be shifting because of the attempted assassination of Trump in Pennsylvania. So, at that time, Stewart and his team might not have known whether their chosen venue would become off-limits to members of the public who bought tickets to the show. But at the time he was airing his reasons Tuesday night for canceling his Milwaukee trip, there were no changes to the security zone – making his statement off-base.  Stewart claimed that the Marcus Performing Arts Center, where his team was set to tape episodes of ""The Daily Show"" during the RNC, was originally located in the ""soft"" security perimeter but ""was shifted, understandably so, to the ‘hard perimeter.’""  Though there were questions at the time ""The Daily Show"" pulled out of the trip to Milwaukee about whether the security perimeter would change, it did not ultimately change.

That’s in line with what former President Donald Trump and his allies wanted to do.     Vance has said in interviews that the election was ""stolen"" from Trump.","Vice President Kamala Harris said in a campaign video that former President Donald Trump’s pick for vice president will be ""loyal only to Trump, not to our country."" Harris said in the  video  that the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, will ""rubber stamp"" Trump’s ""extreme agenda."" She added, ""Unlike Mike Pence, Vance said he would have carried out Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election."" After losing the 2020 election, Trump and his allies sought to  enlist help  from state elected officials, Justice Department officials and then-Vice President Mike  Pence  to stay in office.  Trump allies put forward their own slates of ""alternate"" electors to sign certificates declaring that Trump won battleground states that he actually lost. Trump critics have referred to them as ""fake electors"" and state prosecutors have  criminally charged  dozens of them. On Jan. 6, 2021, Pence refused to consider Trump’s alternate slates of electors.  Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss happened before Vance was a senator, so Vance was not in position to vote to accept the electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021. Vance won the  U.S. Senate race  in 2022.  We examined how Vance has addressed this issue in media interviews and found that he hasn’t directly said he would have overturned the election. But comments he’s made that Congress should have considered multiple slates of electors align with plans by Trump and his allies to have an alternate slate of electors vote for Trump. Vance has also said the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from Trump. When Congress meets  to certify the election results, the vice president opens the envelopes from each state that contain the results that determine which candidate received that state’s electoral votes. These results, presented in official certificates, have been signed and sealed. The vice president opens the envelopes and hands them to four members from the House and Senate who read the results aloud. At the end, the vice president announces the final tally. Pence has  said  that Trump asked him to overturn the election by returning or rejecting votes cast for Biden. Pence said he had no authority to do that. In a February 2024  interview,  ABC’s ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos asked Vance how he would have handled the election results if he had been vice president in 2020. Vance said there should have been multiple slates of electors. In 2022,  Congress clarified  the Electoral Count Act to say the vice president’s role is strictly ""ministerial"" and binds Congress to accept a single slate of electors from each state. Stephanopoulos asked Vance, ""Had you been vice president on Jan. 6, would you have certified the election results?"" Vance said he thought there were problems with the 2020 election, including changes in Pennsylvania balloting rules. (In October 2019, Pennsylvania’s General Assembly passed  Act 77  to permit no-excuse, mail-in voting.) ""So, litigating which slate of electors were legitimate I think is fundamentally the political solution to the problems that existed in 2020,"" Vance said. Stephanopoulos again asked: ""Would you have certified the election results had you been vice president?"" Vance said, ""If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there. That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that's what we should have done."" Stephanopoulos said to Vance, ""So, it's very clear, you would have done what Donald Trump asked you to do there, not what Vice President Mike Pence did.""  Vance said, ""It’s not about what Donald Trump asks somebody to do. It's about, what do we do when you have a problem like what happened in 2020? How do you respond to it? How does the political system respond to this?"" When Vance ran for U.S. Senate, he told  Time magazine  in a July 2021 interview that he thought the 2020 election was ""unfair.""  ""I think Josh Hawley did the right thing,"" he said. Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, led the Senate charge  against  Congress accepting Joe Biden’s victory — a position he kept after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Much of Hawley’s argument was based on  changes to Pennsylvania mail-in voting . Courts , state election officials, including Georgia Republicans, and Trump administration officials said that the 2020 election results were legitimate. By contrast, Vance has  claimed  that people voted illegally ""on a large-scale basis.""   During a Senate  primary debate in 2022 , Vance said, ""I say it all the time: I think the election was stolen from Trump.""  Weeks before the 2022 midterms, the  The Cincinnati Enquirer  asked Vance, ""Do you believe President Joe Biden was legitimately elected in 2020?"" Vance said, ""I mean, he's the president, right? He is certainly the legitimate president of the United States. The thing that I've always said here, and I'll repeat to you, is, ‘Was the election in 2020 free and fair, was it above board?’ My answer is no, I really don't think that it was."" In a June 2024 interview with Ross Douthat, a conservative opinion columnist at  The New York Times,  Vance said there should have been an effort to provide alternate slates of electors ""to force us to have that debate."" He also said that ""challenging elections and questioning the legitimacy of elections"" is part of the democratic process. CNN’s Dana Bash  asked  Vance on May 12 whether he would commit to accepting the 2024 election results. ""Certainly, if we have a free and fair election, I will accept the results,"" Vance said.  Bash asked Vance, ""Even if Joe Biden wins?"" Vance said, ""Sure. If it's a free and fair election, I will accept the results, Dana, whoever wins."" Harris said, ""Unlike Mike Pence, Vance said he would have carried out Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election."" Vance hasn’t said exactly that. But he has said he supported Trump’s plan to present Congress with alternate slates of electors on Jan. 6, 2021, that showed Trump winning battleground states he actually had lost. Vance’s statement showed he supported pursuing a path that would have allowed Congress to challenge Biden’s victory.

politifact,"After being shot at a Milwaukee rally in 1912, former President Teddy Roosevelt “finished his speech and he kept fighting.”","When former President Donald Trump headed to Milwaukee after an attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania, conservatives sought to tie him to a former president who was shot in the city.      In 1912, Teddy Roosevelt was shot leaving the Gilpatrick Hotel in Milwaukee on his way to give a speech. Historical reports show his metal glasses case in his coat pocket, and a thick copy of his prepared remarks, slowed the bullet.      Roosevelt went on to deliver a lengthy speech. He wasn’t shot during the rally itself, as Trump was — rather beforehand, and he decided to go speak anyway.      Though Donald Trump Jr. got that detail wrong in his attempt to relate the incident to what happened to his father, he’s largely right about the story.","When former President Donald Trump arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, comparisons to the plight of another storied former president were plentiful.  Trump, the GOP nominee to take on President Joe Biden this fall, flew to Wisconsin after a rally in Pennsylvania during which he was shot in the ear with a bullet  that was meant to take his life .  More than a century ago, former Republican President Teddy Roosevelt was visiting Milwaukee for a rally when  he was shot and injured in an assassination attempt .  That attempted assassination isn’t very well known, but it’s been a talking point at the convention this week as conservatives seek to tie Trump to Roosevelt, who carefully cultivated a manly image.  Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., referred to it  during his Wednesday night speech  at the convention, broadcast to millions of viewers across the country.  ""At a political rally less than 1 mile from where we stand tonight, Teddy Roosevelt was struck by a would-be assassin’s bullet,"" Trump Jr. said. ""But he didn’t quit, either. He finished his speech and kept fighting.""  Trump Jr. has the general idea right, but is off on a few details — which make the story of what happened to Roosevelt all the more interesting. Roosevelt was touring the Midwest when he visited Milwaukee in 1912, campaigning for a third term as president because he was unhappy with the work of then-President William Howard Taft,  according to a Library of Congress article on the incident . He arrived in the city Oct. 14, 1912. He dined at the Gilpatrick Hotel — now the site of the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee — then set out to head to the Milwaukee Auditorium, now Miller High Life Theatre, to give his speech.  Outside the hotel, he was shot by a man named John Schrank from New York City, who had followed Roosevelt through several states to attempt to kill him. Roosevelt fell back and the bullet pierced his chest, according to the Library of Congress article — but not before it was slowed by a metal eyeglasses case and a 50-page copy of his speech folded in half.  After Schrank was taken into custody, Roosevelt was driven to the auditorium — about a block away — and delivered an hour-plus speech to the crowd with the bullet still inside him, using his bloodied shirt as a symbol of his resilience. He was then rushed to the hospital.  So, although Trump was actively delivering his speech at a rally when he was shot, Roosevelt wasn’t in the exact same situation, as Trump Jr. claimed. He was shot before his speech and decided to give it anyway. (Granted, the security procedures for protecting a former president after an assassination attempt were likely much different in 1912 than they are today.)  The attempt on Roosevelt’s life was one event that shaped his image as a ""self-made cowboy soldier,""  History.com describes , who ""embodied a new ideal of manliness.""  Republicans have been pitching themselves for years as ""the party of manliness, the alphas, of the tough ones,"" American University assistant professor of public communications Kurt Braddock  told The Washington Post . Drawing parallels between Trump and Roosevelt, Braddock said, feeds that idea.  Trump Jr., in connecting the attempted assassination of his father to the one of Roosevelt in Milwaukee in 1912, said Roosevelt was struck at a political rally, ""finished his speech and kept fighting.""  It wasn’t midrally, as happened to Trump, but Roosevelt certainly did press on, cementing a forceful image of himself that Trump supporters seek to have the public remember.

politifact,Kamala Harris “is not eligible to hold the office of president” because her parents were non-citizens.,"Vice President Kamala Harris was born in 1964 in Oakland, California.     The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that people born in the United States are citizens.     Only natural-born citizens are eligible to be president, Article II of the Constitution says. Harris, born in the U.S., meets that standard, legal experts said.","Birtherism is back, it seems, now that support is coalescing around Vice President Kamala for the Democratic presidential nomination after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her. ""Unless proven with court documents at the time of Kamala’s birth, her parents were not U.S. citizens,"" said text under a copy of Harris’ birth certificate  shared  July 21 on Instagram. ""They were foreign students. At the time of her birth, she was the daughter of non-citizens. This makes her an anchor baby. She is not eligible to hold the office of president."" We found similar claims  shared  on  other  social media  platforms  following Biden’s July 21 announcement. This Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Claims that politicians aren’t eligible to be president began in earnest in the 2008 presidential election cycle  when then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., first ran  for the White House. Some people baselessly questioned whether he was really born in Hawaii — a false line of attack later  fueled by Donald Trump  before Trump launched his own presidential campaign. Past Republican presidential candidates Sen.  Ted Cruz , R-Texas, (born in Canada to a U.S. citizen mother) and Sen.  John McCain , R-Ariz., (born in the Panama Canal Zone to two U.S. citizens) have faced similar scrutiny. PolitiFact has  debunked  these  claims  about Harris before, but because the claims surfaced again following her July 21  announcement  that she intends to seek the presidency, we’re taking a fresh look. Harris’ parents, Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, met while they were students at the University of California, Berkeley. They married but separated when Harris was 5 years old, Harris wrote in her 2019 book, "" The Truths we Hold: An American Journey .""  A copy of Harris’ birth certificate  posted online  in August 2020 by the Bay Area News Group to accompany a San Jose Mercury News  article  shows Donald Harris was born in Jamaica and Gopalan was born in India. It does not show their citizenship status.  Donald Harris’  biography  at Stanford University, where he was an economics professor, shows that, at some point, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Gopalan, who died of cancer in 2009,  became  a breast cancer researcher whose work took her around the world. We could find no evidence she became a U.S. citizen. Gopalan moved to Montreal for a teaching position when Harris was in middle school. Kamala Harris later left Montreal to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C., her book said. Harris’ birth certificate shows she was born in 1964 at a hospital in Oakland, California, in Alameda County. Legal experts told PolitiFact that’s all that’s needed to show Harris is eligible to be president. Her parents’ citizenship status when she was born isn’t a factor. (Instagram screenshot) ""Yes, she is unquestionably eligible,"" Columbia University law professor Jessica Bulman-Pozen said. She pointed to the U.S. Constitution’s  Article 2 , which states that: ""No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President."" ""As someone born in the United States, Harris is a ‘natural born citizen,’"" Bulman-Pozen said. University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt said the Constitution’s 14th Amendment ""is very clear that people born in the U.S. are citizens."" ""The only exception is for children of foreign diplomats, who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States."" The 14th Amendment  states  that: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" Bulman-Pozen said there have been debates about the eligibility of people born outside the U.S. to U.S.-citizen parents, as McCain was, but said ""there is no plausible argument that someone born in the U.S. is not a natural born citizen."" ""If there was any doubt, section one of the 14th Amendment confirms the U.S. norm of birthright citizenship,"" she said. Harris was born in California, which means she is a natural-born citizen.

Biden has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.      Under Washington law, presidential candidates must be certified for the November ballot by Aug. 20, which falls before the Democratic nominee could be formally elected at the Democratic National Convention. Washington’s secretary of state will accept a letter from the Democratic National Committee attesting to the party’s alternate nominee, a spokesperson said.","Shortly after President Joe Biden  dropped out  of the presidential race and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, some social media users claimed his  late departure  presented an opportunity for former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, to win  historically ""blue"" states .

That August ballot includes candidates for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, statewide executive offices, the state Legislature, state court positions, local races and local ballot measures, according to the secretary of state’s  website . Washington held its presidential primary election separately, on  March 12 . Biden won the Democratic primary and Trump won the Republican primary, according to the  certified election results .  For the state’s August primary, county election offices were required to mail out ballots by July 19, according to the secretary of state’s  website .  The website noted: ""The August Primary does not include President/Vice President.""  Derrick Nunnally, spokesperson for Washington’s secretary of state, confirmed: ""Washington’s ballots for the Aug. 6 state primary are out; these do not include the Presidential election.""  Although Harris has  enough support   from delegates  to win the Democratic presidential nomination, delegates will not vote for the nominee  until August .  Washington state’s Democratic party has also expressed support for Harris.

Those deadlines are generally after the convention.,"After President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race July 21, some social media users claimed his late announcement leaves no opportunity for some states to change their ballots to accommodate another candidate’s name. An  Instagram post  said there are nine states ""where Biden’s name can’t be removed and no one can be added. That’s over 130 electoral votes in the toilet.""  It lists these states: Alabama, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington.  The post attributed the information to Grok,  which is   X’s AI chatbot. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) It’s wrong to say that Biden’s name can’t be ""removed"" because it hasn’t yet been placed on ballots. Biden was the presumptive nominee — not the official nominee. Election officials in the states listed in the Instagram post have  said  in  written   statements  and in emails to PolitiFact that their deadlines for the party to submit its nominees’ names for the ballot have not yet passed. Democrats are expected to choose their nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Aug. 19 to 22, or likely earlier — perhaps Aug. 7, in a virtual roll call vote. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who appears  likely to get the nomination . Once that happens, the nominees’ names will be forwarded to state election officials, who will place them on the ballot. Because there currently is no formal nominee, and because state ballot deadlines haven’t passed yet,  legal experts say  there’s no problem listing someone other than Biden on ballots. But Republicans may file legal challenges, and the U.S. Supreme Court could have the final say.  David Becker, executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit that  works with election officials,  wrote on X  that statements that Democrats can’t ""substitute"" a nominee for Biden in several states is ""100% false."" ""Biden is not ON the ballot in any state,"" Becker wrote. ""Dems don’t have a nominee yet. Once they do, after delegates vote, that person will be on the ballot in every state."" Alabama : Secretary of State Wes Allen said in a  statement  July 21 that ​​major parties have until Aug. 23 to formally announce their presidential and vice presidential candidates to the secretary of state’s office, which will certify the candidates by Aug. 28. Alabama law had initially set an Aug. 15 deadline — 82 days before the election — to confirm candidates. But because this was before the DNC, the state House  unanimously passed  legislation in May to extend the deadline.  Indiana : Secretary of State Diego Morales issued a  statement  July 22 confirming the Sept. 10 deadline for parties to submit candidates.  Michigan : Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a July 22  statement  that presidential candidates appear on the ballot as a result of the party nominating conventions’ outcomes. Under state law, the nominees’ names must be delivered to Michigan’s State Department within one business day of the party convention’s conclusion, meaning an Aug. 26 deadline. Minnesota : The deadline for parties to submit presidential and vice-presidential candidates to the secretary of state’s office is  Aug. 26  — 71 days before the general election.  New Mexico : Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver on July 22  confirmed  the state’s ballot deadline of Aug. 27.  ""The ballot deadline has not passed in New Mexico,"" Toulouse Oliver said.  Ohio : The Ohio Legislature changed the ballot deadline to Sept. 1. Although the previous deadline was Aug. 7, the House  passed legislation  in May that extended the date.  Pennsylvania : Under the Pennsylvania election code, the presidential and vice presidential nominees selected at the Democratic National Convention will appear on the general election ballot as the Democratic candidates for president and vice president. At least 70 days before the election, the secretary must provide the counties with names of all known candidates. This year, that date is Aug. 27.  Texas : As our partners at  The Dallas Morning News  reported and we confirmed, Texas state law sets a deadline of 74 days before the election for a candidate to withdraw and 71 days for the party to provide a replacement. That means that the Texas Democratic Party has until Aug. 26 to submit the names of its nominees. Washington : According to state law, presidential candidates  must be certified  for the November ballot  by Aug. 20 , which falls before the Democratic National Convention.  But Washington secretary of state Spokesperson Derrick Nunnally told PolitiFact that state officials would  accept a letter  from the Democratic National Committee attesting to the party’s alternate nominee.  ""This possibility was provided to accommodate the Democratic party’s stated nomination schedule after reviewing both state law and precedent from 2020,"" Nunnally said, noting that in 2020 both parties submitted ""provisional nominations"" because of a misalignment of the convention schedules and law deadline. An Instagram post said that there are nine states ""where Biden’s name can’t be removed and no one can be added.

La publicación fue marcada como parte del esfuerzo de Meta para combatir las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma. (Lea más sobre  nuestra colaboración con Meta , propietaria de Facebook e Instagram). Afirmaciones que indican que algún político no es elegible para ser presidente de Estados Unidos no son nuevas. Comentarios similares surgieron en las elecciones presidenciales de 2008, cuando el entonces senador  Barack Obama se postuló  por primera vez a la Casa Blanca. Algunos cuestionaron, sin fundamento, si realmente había nacido en Hawai.  Donald Trump sostuvo  esta falsa línea de ataque antes de lanzar su propia campaña presidencial.  Otros candidatos presidenciales del partido republicano se han enfrentado a un escrutinio similar. Fue el caso del senador  Ted Cruz , republicano por Texas (nacido en Canadá de madre estadounidense). También ocurrió con el senador  John McCain , republicano por Arizona (nacido en la zona del Canal de Panamá de dos ciudadanos estadounidenses). PolitiFact  desmintió  estas  afirmaciones  sobre Harris en otras ocasiones. Pero salieron nuevamente a la luz pública, después de que Harris  anunciara  su intención de presentarse a las elecciones presidenciales. Las analizamos de nuevo. Los padres de Harris, Donald Harris y Shyamala Gopalan, se conocieron mientras estudiaban en la Universidad de California, Berkeley. Se casaron, pero se separaron cuando Harris tenía cinco años, escribió Harris en su libro de 2019, "" Las verdades que sostenemos "". El Bay Area News Group  publicó  una copia del certificado de nacimiento de Harris en 2020, junto a un  artículo  del San Jose Mercury News. Este muestra que Donald Harris nació en Jamaica y Gopalan nació en la India. Pero no indica su estatus de ciudadanía.  La  biografía  de Donald Harris en la Universidad de Stanford, donde fue profesor de economía, muestra que, en algún momento, se naturalizó como ciudadano estadounidense. Gopalan, que falleció de cáncer en 2009, se  dedicó  a la investigación del cáncer de mama y su trabajo la llevó por todo el mundo. No hemos encontrado pruebas de que obtuviera la nacionalidad estadounidense. Gopalan se trasladó a Montreal para trabajar como profesora cuando Harris estaba en la escuela secundaria. Más tarde, Harris dejó Montreal para asistir a la Universidad Howard en Washington, D.C., según su libro. El certificado de nacimiento de Harris muestra que nació en 1964 en un hospital de Oakland, California, en el condado de Alameda. Expertos legales dijeron a PolitiFact que eso es todo lo que se necesita para demostrar que Harris es elegible para ser presidenta. El estatus de ciudadanía de sus padres cuando ella nació, no es un factor decisivo. ""Sí, es indiscutiblemente elegible"", dijo la profesora de Derecho de la Universidad de Columbia Jessica Bulman-Pozen.  La profesora señaló que el  Artículo II de la Constitución de EE.UU.  establece en parte que: ""Solo las personas que sean ciudadanos por nacimiento o que hayan sido ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos al tiempo de adoptarse esta Constitución, serán elegibles para el cargo de Presidente"". ""Como persona nacida en Estados Unidos, Harris es una 'ciudadana por nacimiento'"", dijo Bulman-Pozen. El profesor de Derecho de la Universidad de Pensilvania Kermit Roosevelt dijo que la 14ª Enmienda de la Constitución ""deja muy claro que las personas nacidas en EE.UU. son ciudadanos"". ""La única excepción son los hijos de diplomáticos extranjeros, que no están sujetos a la jurisdicción de Estados Unidos"", dijo Roosevelt. La 14ª Enmienda  establece  en parte que: ""Todas las personas nacidas o naturalizadas en Estados Unidos, y sujetas a su jurisdicción, son ciudadanos de Estados Unidos y del estado en el que residan"". Bulman-Pozen dijo que ha habido debates sobre la elegibilidad de las personas nacidas fuera de EE.UU. de padres ciudadanos estadounidenses, como fue el caso de McCain. Pero dijo que ""no hay ningún argumento plausible de que alguien nacido en EE.UU. no sea un ciudadano"". ""Si hubiera alguna duda, la sección uno de la 14ª Enmienda confirma la norma estadounidense de la ciudadanía por derecho de nacimiento"", dijo Bulman-Pozen. Harris nació en California, lo que significa que es ciudadana de nacimiento.

Another X account known to  promote QAnon  and  misinformation  also shared the clip of Cheatle’s testimony, noting Jackson Lee’s Secret Service oversight and  saying  that she ""was confirmed dead six days after the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump. Just another coincidence right?"" Claims  like these   were also  shared on Facebook and Instagram.  Jackson Lee died July 19 at age 74. She served as a Houston judge and city councilor before being elected to Texas’ 18th Congressional District in 1994,  CNN reported . She was  a mother and grandmother  and was among  the first women  to graduate from Yale University. She formerly served as whip of the Congressional Black Caucus and, when she died, she  was  a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a chief deputy whip for House Democrats. ""Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announced the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,"" a July 19  statement  from her family said. ""She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy.""  Although a cause of death has not been publicly reported, Jackson Lee  said in June  that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We contacted a spokesperson for Jackson Lee’s office and received no response before publication. There is no evidence that her death is considered suspicious. The claims that Jackson Lee’s death was somehow linked to oversight of the U.S. Secret Service followed remarks in Cheatle’s congressional testimony. In her opening statement, Cheatle  first acknowledged  the assassination attempt was ""the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades."" She offered condolences to the family of rally attendee Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the attack, and wished the other two men injured in Butler ""a speedy recovery.""   ""I would be remiss if I did not also extend my condolences on the passing of your colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,"" Cheatle  said . ""Ms. Jackson Lee was always engaged in the oversight of the Secret Service, and her passing is a great loss to this body."" Cheatle was addressing a room of Jackson Lee’s fellow House members, but Jackson Lee was  not a member  of the Oversight Committee when she died. Social media users seized on Cheatle’s comments about Jackson Lee, who had been a senior member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget  committees .  We searched using Google and Nexis and found no reliable news reports claiming that Jackson Lee's death was connected to Secret Service oversight work or the Trump rally shooting.  The Secret Service is part of the Department of Homeland Security, so some of Jackson Lee’s Homeland Security Committee work might have involved the Secret Service. But we found no reports showing Jackson Lee’s work  focused specifically  on the Secret Service. We contacted the Secret Service to ask what ""oversight"" Cheatle had referred to and received no response before publication. After the assassination attempt on Trump, Jackson Lee  condemned  political violence and acknowledged the Secret Service’s protective efforts.  ""My thoughts and well wishes are with former President Trump and his family — I wish him a speedy recovery,"" she said. ""Reports inform that he is safe through the swift actions of Secret Service Agents.""  She described the Trump rally attack as ""deeply disturbing.""  ""Political violence has no place in the United States,"" she said. ""This incident should be a catalyst for renewing our commitment to not allow violence to infect the political life of our nation.""  Social media posts linked Jackson Lee’s death six days after the Trump rally shooting to her ""oversight of the Secret Service.""  Jackson Lee, died July 19. Although a cause of death has not been publicly reported, she’d   said in June  that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We found nothing to support claims her death was connected to Secret Service oversight.  We rate this claim False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

politifact,Rose Garden video shows that President Joe Biden was taller when he emerged from July 24 Oval Office speech.,"The video of President Joe Biden walking out to the White House’s Rose Garden was shot at a lower angle. Because the camera was pointing up at Biden, it made him look taller.     In the video, Biden was standing a few steps in front of first lady Jill Biden, making him appear bigger because he was closer to the camera. In another photo from that day, the Bidens were standing beside each other, and their height difference was less exaggerated.","After President Joe Biden addressed the nation July 24 about his decision to exit the 2024 presidential race, Biden walked out into the White House’s Rose Garden standing tall. But some social media users claimed the president looked too tall. A July 25  Instagram post  shared a video of Biden walking from the Oval Office to the Rose Garden, with first lady Jill Biden and other Biden family members standing behind him. The video’s narrator said, ""People are saying Joe Biden looks a lot taller."" The Instagram video then showed photos of Joe and Jill Biden together to note their height difference, implying that it wasn’t as big in those instances. ""There’s obviously something going on here,"" the narrator said, flashing back to the Rose Garden and noting that Jill Biden was wearing heels. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) (Screengrab from Instagram) We saw the  same claim   circulating   on X , where the footage of Biden was  being   used   to prop up  the false conspiracy theory that Biden employs a body double for public appearances. This conspiracy  gained traction  ahead of the June 27 presidential debate. PolitiFact and other news outlets have  repeatedly   fact-checked   false   claims  that Biden employs a  body double  or that video footage shows a  masked   impersonator   instead  of the real Biden. Social media users have also speculated that Biden’s recent appearances, including a  July 22 phone call  with Vice President Kamala Harris, have been generated with artificial intelligence. We found  no credible evidence  to support this claim. Also, people  stop growing during adolescence . So, it’s biologically improbable that Biden, as an 81-year-old, grew taller over the few days he isolated in his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home following his COVID-19 diagnosis July 17. Biden’s  official health summary  from February says he is 6 feet tall.  So, if Biden doesn’t have a body double, and he didn’t have miraculous growth spurt, what explains Biden’s taller appearance in the Rose Garden video?  It’s the camera angle. Biden was standing atop the steps by the colonnade outside of the Oval Office, and the cameraperson was in the Rose Garden. So, Biden stood in an elevated position compared with the person filming. Angling a camera up at people  can make them   look taller  in photos and videos. (Left image is a screengrab from Instagram. Right photo is courtesy of The Associated Press.) Joe Biden also appears taller in the video because he is standing a few steps in front of Jill Biden, and people closer to the camera will naturally look bigger.  Another photo of the Bidens , which was taken just before they walked out of the Oval Office and toward the Rose Garden, shows less of an apparent height difference because they are standing side by side.

politifact,Kamala Harris “supported abolishing ICE.”,"As a U.S. senator in 2018, Kamala Harris criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including a policy that led to family separations at the border.     In that context, Harris said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s function should be reexamined and that ""we need to probably even think about starting from scratch.""     But Harris didn’t say there shouldn’t be immigration enforcement. In 2018, Harris also said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had a role and should exist.","In a flurry of attacks against his likely 2024 presidential opponent, former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris allowed millions of immigrants to illegally ""stampede"" across the border and supported eliminating a central immigration enforcement agency.  ""Lyin’ Kamala supported abolishing ICE,"" Trump  said  July 24 at a Charlotte, North Carolina, campaign rally.  Trump, who pilloried several parts of Harris’ record, was referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency in charge of detaining and deporting immigrants who are illegally in the United States.  In spring 2018, the ""abolish ICE"" movement drew attention after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York won her House primary and  said  it was ""time to abolish"" the agency.  A  small number  of  Democratic  lawmakers or candidates supported the ""abolish ICE"" movement as a protest against Trump policies. Congress  never abolished  Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump and Harris campaigns responded to our query about Trump’s rally claim with multiple citations of Harris statements; we found many more through our own research. There is no record of Harris saying she would ""abolish ICE,"" a specific phrase that others like Ocasio-Cortez have used. And in 2019, when asked point-blank if she supports abolishing the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  Harris said no. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told PolitiFact that Harris ""ran on a platform dedicated to defunding the police and abolishing ICE, and there is no question that she will implement these horrible policies if she has the chance."" Harris, as a California senator, criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including a deterrence policy that led to the separation of children and parents who arrived at the border illegally. In a March  2018 MSNBC interview , Harris said Immigration and Customs Enforcement should exist to deport people who commit serious and violent crimes, including rape, murder and child molestation. ""So, yes, ICE has a purpose. ICE has a role, ICE should exist,"" Harris said. ""But let’s not abuse the power. Let’s not extend it to areas that were not — that are not posing a threat to the safety and the public safety of these communities, especially when we know that these federal agencies have limited resources to do their core job."" The Trump campaign pointed to a  June 2018 MSNBC interview  in which host Kasie Hunt asked Harris whether she agreed with the calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Harris: ""Listen, I think there is no question that we’ve got to critically reexamine ICE and its role and the way it is being administered and the work it is doing. And we need to probably even think about starting from scratch because there’s a lot that is wrong with the way that it is conducting itself and we need to deal with that."" Hunt: ""What do you think should be the alternative to ICE?"" Harris: ""Well, first of all, I don't think that the government should be in the position of separating families and that is clearly what is part of what's happening at ICE and DHS. You look at what’s happening again in terms of how they are conducting their perspective on asylum seekers. That is a real problem and is contrary to all the spirit and the reason we even have the asylum rules and laws in the first place. So, their mission I think is very much in question and has to be reexamined."" On  ABC’s ""The View""  in 2019, Harris was asked whether she would abolish the Department of Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""No, I would not,"" Harris said. She called the department ""dysfunctional"" and said the government needs to ""fix it, but I do not believe in getting rid of it.""  The Trump campaign also pointed to other Harris statements that were critical of  Trump’s immigration enforcement policies , but none of the comments go as far as Trump claimed in his remarks. In 2019, Harris called raids on workplaces the Trump administration’s  ""campaign of terror""  that she said would make immigrants afraid to go to work.  Harris co-sponsored legislation  to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests at schools, hospitals, and religious institutions without prior approval and exigent circumstances. The Washington Post in 2020  reported that Harris was among the politicians who wanted to restructure the agency, but not abolish it.  NPR  reached similar conclusions in 2018. The Trump campaign also pointed to a  2008 New York Times article written  when Harris was San Francisco district attorney. But this article does not address Harris’ stance on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s existence;  it said San Francisco was assuring immigrants who were in the country illegally that the city would not report them to federal immigration authorities. In the article, Harris said criminals tend to tell their victims who are in the country illegally that they will be treated as criminals because of their immigration status. Harris’ 2019 presidential primary  immigration platform  did not call for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She called to overhaul immigration enforcement policies and focus enforcement on increasing public safety. The  Biden-Harris ticket’s 2020 campaign platform  also did not call for abolishing the agency.  In February 2024,  Harris backed  bipartisan legislation that included border enforcement. The  bill  sought to limit the number of asylum seekers and  included funding  for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to increase detention capacity and removal flights and hire more personnel.  That proposal died amid Republican opposition. Trump said Harris ""supported abolishing ICE."" It’s clear that Harris opposed, and opposes, many of Trump’s immigration positions. And she called for an end to the hard-line tactics that had been used by the administration. But she never said she would abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In fact, she said the opposite.

politifact,Kamala Harris “wants to defund the police.”,"Calls by some liberals to ""defund the police"" followed a police officer’s murder of George Floyd. ""Defund"" is not an official legal term and can mean anything from closing a police department to diverting some of its budget to social services.     In 2020, then-Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., called for ""reimagining"" public safety. But she didn’t explicitly call for shuttering police departments.     Harris has said police agencies are necessary and has called for more law enforcement funding.","Former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris ""wants to be the president for savage criminals"" and that Democrats are at ""war"" with police. ""She wants to defund the police,"" Trump  said  during a July 24 rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, his first rally after Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee. ""Now she's pulled back on it."" Trump’s remarks were contradictory because he said ""wants"" — as in present tense, but also said Harris ""pulled back on it,"" as in a past action. He made similar remarks several times in the days following the rally.  The  movement to ""defund"" the police  reached its height in summer 2020, following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. ""Defund"" is not an official legal term and can include closing a police department or diverting some of its budget to social services.  With Harris’ new presidential bid, we wanted to examine her past and present position on defunding police departments. Both the Trump and Harris campaigns responded to our query with  multiple   citations   of   Harris  statements ,  and  we found many through our own research.  Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told PolitiFact that Harris ""ran on a platform dedicated to defunding the police"" and that ""there is no question that she will implement these horrible policies if she has the chance."" The Harris campaign said that she does not support police defunding (as her  campaign told us in 2020 ) and pointed to statements in which she spoke in favor of police funding.  We did not find that Harris called for  dissolving police departments . In 2020, she called for ""reimagining"" public safety and investing in other areas, such as education, but said that the country needed law enforcement. Many of Harris’ comments came shortly after Floyd’s murder and before Biden announced her in August 2020 as his running mate. In a June 2020 radio interview on the  New York show ""Ebro in the Morning,""  One host asked Harris, ""Where do you stand on defund the police?"" Harris said, ""Defund the police, the issue behind it is we need to reimagine how we are creating safety. When you have many cities that have one-third of their entire city budget focused on policing, we know that is not the smart way and the best way or the right way to achieve safety. For too long, the status quo thinking has been you get more safety by putting more cops on the street. Well, that’s wrong."" Harris said suburban communities ""don’t have that patrol car, they don’t have those police walking those streets,"" but what they do have is well-funded schools, high homeownership rates, thriving small businesses and access to health care.  ""This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,"" Harris said.  In a June 2020 interview with the  The New York Times , Harris was asked her thinking on defunding the police. She said, ""Well, it’s a concept. We do have to reimagine what public safety looks like."" But she added that ""We’re not going to get rid of the police. We all have to be practical. But let’s separate out these discussions."" A Trump campaign account in 2020 posted a  clip on X  of Harris saying that it is ""wrong-headed thinking to think that the only way to get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street. What we have to do, and what we will do, is reimagine public safety.""  The full  transcript  of her September 2020 remarks shows that she said didn’t call for defunding police departments. She said safe communities also need investments in schools, health care and small businesses.   The Trump campaign also pointed to Harris’ June 2020 comments praising Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.  ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos  asked Harris whether she supported Garcetti’s proposal to take about $150 million from police and invest it in health initiatives and youth training.  ""We've got to reexamine what we're doing with American taxpayer dollars and ask the question, ‘Are we getting the right return on our investment? Are we actually creating healthy and safe communities?’ And that's a legitimate conversation and it requires a really critical evaluation. And I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he's done."" Stephanopoulos asked, ""So, does it mean, bottom line, we need fewer police on the streets of America right now?"" Harris said that if the country invests in communities ""they will be healthy, they will be strong, and we won't have a need for militarization of police. Right? We have to stop that. We have to stop militarization of police. But that doesn't mean we get rid of police. Of course not."" In October 2020, we fact-checked then-Vice President Mike Pence’s claim that Harris would ""defund, dismantle, and dissolve police departments."" We rated that  False .  We found that when Harris was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019,  her criminal justice platform  did not mention defunding police departments. Her plan called for increasing funding for body cameras, mental health professionals, and ""officer safety and wellness."" In  a June 2020 episode  of ABC’s ""The View,"" host Meghan McCain asked Harris, ""Are you for defunding the police?"" After some back-and-forth about the definition, Harris repeated her stance about needing to ""reimagine"" public safety, review how public funding is allocated and invest in mental health, schools and job training.  We also found  examples  of Harris saying she wants the public to have access to police. On Sept. 6, 2020, Harris  said , ""I want to make sure that if a woman is raped, a child is molested, one human being murders another human being, that there will be a police officer that responds to that case and that there will be accountability and consequence for the offender."" When Harris joined the Biden presidential ticket, the campaign made it clear the running mates were not in favor of defunding. ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,"" Sabrina Singh, Harris’ press secretary,  told PolitiFact in October 2020 . ""Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing."" Harris supported giving federal funding to local or state law enforcement agencies when she was the  San Francisco district attorney ,  California attorney general  and  U.S. senator . The Biden-Harris administration has backed  funding  for law enforcement .  Biden’s fiscal year 2025 budget proposal  called for $1.2 billion over five years to support law enforcement agencies and combat crime. Harris has  supported  police reform initiatives including the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act , which she co-sponsored as a senator. That legislation  would not defund the police ; it would make it easier to sue officers and would require police to complete racial profiling training. Harris  reiterated her support for that legislation  following the July 6 death of  Sonya Massey,  an unarmed Black woman, who called 911 about a prowler and was shot and killed in her Illinois home by a police officer. Trump said Harris ""wants to defund the police."" The Trump campaign points to statements by Harris in 2020 — not in 2024. Shortly after Floyd’s murder, Harris was asked about the ""defund the police"" movement and called for ""reimagining"" public safety. While in 2020 she didn’t explicitly call for getting rid of police departments, she did state support for reexamining police budgets and lauded a proposal by the Los Angeles mayor to shift part of the police budget to community initiatives. But one way that ""defund the police"" is interpreted is dissolving police departments. Harris did not go that far — she said police were necessary. She told The New York Times in June 2020 ""we’re not going to get rid of the police."" Where Trump veers into territory that makes this claim inaccurate is when he spoke in the present tense, although he did follow his sentence with the phrase ""now she's pulled back on it."" When he said that Harris ""wants"" to defund police that leaves voters with the impression that the vice president and presumed presidential nominee is now calling for defunding the police. She is not. We rate this statement Mostly False. PolitiFact Staff Writer Ranjan Jindal contributed to this fact-check.

Social media posts claim that a video shows people stealing ballot boxes from local election sites. The footage shows masked men rushing out of an orange building, carrying large, white, square objects. ""UNDEMOCRATIC: In Punta Cardón, Falcón State, Venezuela, it is reported that several masked men stormed a local voting station and stole the ballot boxes transporting then to an undisclosed location afterwards,"" a July 28  X post  says, using ""then"" when it probably meant ""them."" A July 29  X  post says: ""Venezuelan Gangs Under Control of Dictator Nicolas Maduro Continue Raiding Voting Polls & Stealing the Ballot Boxes in an Attempt to Overthrow the 2024 Venezuelan Presidential Election."" Spanish-language   posts  shared the same video and made similar claims. But these posts misidentify what the men are carrying. They’re toting air conditioning units; the video shows that the objects have vents on the sides and a gray back. Screenshot of X post from July 28, 2024. The official ballot boxes in Venezuela are light brown and have the National Electoral Council logo — the letters ""CNE"" (for Consejo Nacional Electoral) and three lines (yellow, blue and red), which represent the Venezuelan flag’s colors. PolitiFact couldn’t find this video’s origin, but some Facebook users  commented  that they  had seen the video years ago , one said as far back as 2013.  In Venezuela, votes are counted in two ways. One way is via a digital count that is sent to the electoral authorities through encrypted phone lines. The other way involves printed ballots; machines in a voting site print a ballot confirming a person’s vote, then that ballot is put in a box. The machines also print a tabulation with all the registered votes at the end of the election.  The ballots and tabulations must match to confirm the results from each polling site,  according  to the Observatorio Electoral Venezolano, a Venezuela-based nongovernmental organization that monitors  and analyzes elections. After the July 28 election, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was in Tokyo, expressed concerns that the Venezuelan election result ""does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people."" ""It’s critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay, and that the electoral authorities publish the detailed tabulation of votes. The international community is watching this very closely and will respond accordingly,"" Blinken  told reporters  July 29. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado claimed that the election results were fraudulent. (Edmundo González Urrutia replaced Machado as the opposition presidential candidate when the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice  banned  Machado from running for any office for 15 years.) ""I mean this is not just another fraud, I mean this is grossly, grossly ignoring and violating popular sovereignty, there is no way they can explain and justify this, not with the information we have,"" Machado  said , speaking in Spanish, July 29 to national and international media outlets. Machado  said  the election results delivered by the Venezuelan government were ""impossible,"" because they conflicted with the voting tabulations her team collected, which she  said  showed 6.2 million votes for González Urrutia and 2.8 million for Maduro.  ""We have in our hands the voting tabulations that demonstrate our historic, categorical and mathematically irreversible triumph,"" González Urrutia  said , speaking in Spanish, July 29. The New York Times  reported  July 28 that ""officials at some polling places refused to release printouts verifying the electronic vote count, and there were reports of voter intimidation and other irregularities."" NBC News  also reported July 29 about voter intimidation and irregularities at voting centers during the election. Social media posts claim that a video shows ""several masked men stormed a local voting station and stole the ballot boxes"" during Venezuela’s 2024 election.  But the video shows men carrying air conditioning units.

politifact,Vice President Kamala Harris is “calling for an end to the child tax credit.”,"Vice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly expressed support for the child tax credit.     The Biden administration approved the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which expanded the child tax credit that year to $3,600 per child younger than 6, and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17. The current amount is $2,000 per child, up to age 16.     The administration has pressured Congress to make the more generous credits permanent.","Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance defended his past remarks about childless women by falsely claiming that Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, wants to end a tax credit for parents. Vance has gotten  a lot of backlash  about a pair of interviews he gave in 2021, one in which he complained the U.S was being run by "" a bunch of childless cat ladies ,"" and another in which he said childless Americans should  pay higher tax rates . Vance has since told  Sirius XM radio host Megyn Kelly  and  Fox News  that his comments were taken out of context.  Then, the Ohio senator shifted to Harris. ""Why do we have the Harris campaign coming out this very morning, Megyn, and saying that we should not have the child tax credit, which lowers tax rates for parents of young children? It's because they have become antifamily and antikid,"" Vance  told Kelly  on July 26.  He followed up with the similar claim in a  July 28 interview  with Fox News host Trey Gowdy. ""How did we get to this place where Kamala Harris is calling for an end to the child tax credit?"" Vance said.  She isn’t. PolitiFact found no evidence that Harris has ever called to end the child tax credit. On the contrary, she supports it. The Biden-Harris administration  expanded  the tax credit in 2021, when the American Rescue Plan became law, and Harris has pushed Congress to make the credit permanent. We contacted Vance’s Senate office and the Trump campaign for comment but did not hear back by publication. Congress established the  child tax credit  in 1997 to financially support families with children. The amount and age of eligibility have been increased and expanded multiple times, with bipartisan support, since 2001.  The credit provides families up to $2,000 per child younger than 17. Taxpayers who don’t owe enough in taxes to benefit from the credit could receive a refund of up to $1,400, but not the full $2,000. Eligibility for the credit phases out at higher income levels — currently single filers making $200,000 a year or more, or $400,000 for joint filers.  The  American Rescue Plan,  which passed Congress with slim Democratic majorities before President Joe Biden signed it into law in March 2021, increased the credit for the 2021 filing year. The measure  expanded the credit  to $3,600 per child younger than 6, and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17. The credit was also made fully refundable, making households eligible to receive the full benefit. (The credit reverted in 2022 to the previous $2,000-per-child maximum.) Harris  called  the increased child tax credit ""one of the most important, one of the most impactful parts of the American Rescue Plan."" The tax credit helped lift 2.9 million children out of poverty in 2021, a  Census Bureau paper found . Almost three-quarters of the children benefited from the 2021 expansion, the report said. The Biden administration has pushed to make the 2021 credit increase permanent, including it in the White House’s  2025 fiscal year budget  blueprint. In January, Harris lauded the House for passing  a bipartisan tax package  that includes the child tax credit expansion. ""Good news: The Child Tax Credit bill is headed to the Senate,"" Harris posted  Feb. 1 on X  ""While @POTUS and I continue to fight for the full expanded Child Tax Credit, this bill should be passed quickly. President Biden is ready to sign it into law."" The bill  has   languished  in the Senate, where some Republicans oppose the measure without revisions that limit the credits’ parameters; they’re calling for eliminating a ""look-back"" policy that would let taxpayers use a previous year’s income if it yielded a larger child tax credit.  Other Republicans on social media echoed Vance’s quip about Harris and the child tax credit. The chatter stems from a  report  by the Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news outlet, about a Harris staff member’s criticism of Vance on  X . Before we explain further, no, a campaign staff member’s X post does not represent the presidential candidate’s policy. Here’s what happened. Ammar Moussa, the Harris campaign’s rapid response director, criticized Vance’s past remarks on parents benefiting from tax policy. Moussa shared an  ABC News story  about Vance’s 2021 remarks on ""The Charlie Kirk Show"" podcast. Vance said U.S. tax policy needed to ""reward the things that we think are good"" and ""punish the things that we think are bad."" Vance told Kirk, ""So, you talk about tax policy, let's tax the things that are bad and not tax the things that are good. If you are making $100,000, $400,000 a year and you've got three kids, you should pay a different, lower tax rate than if you are making the same amount of money and you don't have any kids. It's that simple."" Moussa  wrote on X , ""JD Vance’s attacks on childless Americans is even vile. He called for HIGHER taxes on those without children."" The child tax credit effectively lowers taxes for families with children, so the Daily Caller and  some   Republicans  framed Moussa’s claim as being against the credits. Moussa was responding to Vance’s case for parents paying a ""different, lower tax rate"" than nonparents.  Vance said Harris is ""calling on ending the child tax credit."" Harris has not called for this; she has repeatedly expressed support for the child tax credit. The Biden administration approved an increase of the credit in 2021 so it covered more children and awarded more money per child. The White House has lobbied Congress to make the pandemic-era benefit permanent. Vance’s claim that Harris has called to end something that she actually wants expanded is not only wrong, but ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

En Venezuela, los votos son contados de dos formas. Una es vía el conteo digital que es enviado a las autoridades electorales a través de líneas telefónicas encriptadas. La otra forma envuelve a boletas impresas; las máquinas en los centros de votación imprimen una boleta que confirma el voto de una persona, luego este se pone en una caja. La máquina también imprime unas actas con todos los votos registrados al final de la elección.  Las boletas y actas deben coincidir para confirmar los resultados de cada centro de votación,  según  el Observatorio Electoral Venezolano, una organización no gubernamental basada en Venezuela que monitorea y analiza las elecciones.  Después de la elección del 28 de julio, el Secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Anthony Blinken, quien estaba en Tokio, expresó preocupación de que el resultado de la elección venezolana ""no refleje la voluntad o los votos del pueblo venezolano"". ""Es fundamental que cada voto se cuente de forma justa y transparente, que los funcionarios electorales compartan inmediatamente la información con la oposición y los observadores independientes sin demora y que las autoridades electorales publiquen la tabulación detallada de los votos.

Trump and Vance have rebutted claims that they support it.","Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign attacked Ohio Sen. JD Vance in a social media post that it said highlighted the Republican vice presidential nominee’s support for a controversial conservative platform. ""JD Vance endorses Project 2025,"" the Harris campaign wrote in a  July 27  X post that shared a nearly two-minute video of Vance.  ""We really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power. ... I don't think there’s a compromise that we’re gonna come with. ... Unless we overthrow them in some way, we’re gonna keep losing,"" the X post quoted Vance as saying. We also saw a  similar post  on Meta’s Threads platform, which presented the clip as ""a stunning new leak"" showing Vance’s alleged endorsement of Project 2025. That post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Project 2025 refers to a 922-page guide for an incoming Republican administration. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank leading Project 2025, published the document  April 21, 2023 .  But the Harris campaign’s claim is inaccurate: This video does not show Vance endorsing Project 2025 — he made these comments in 2021, more than a month before announcing his Senate run and two years before the Project 2025 plan was made public. The Federalist, a conservative news outlet, first posted this video of Vance  May 18, 2021 , on its YouTube channel. Vance  launched  his Senate bid in early July 2021.  The clip from the Harris’ campaign’s X post appears  about 25 minutes  into the full interview, when Federalist co-founder Ben Domenech asked Vance how he might help close what he described as a growing divide between military and nonmilitary families. Here was Vance’s full response. Vance:  ""I think part of the answer is that the next time that we get power, whether it’s in the Senate or the House or the presidency — we’re talking President (Ron) DeSantis in 2024 or President (Donald) Trump round two in 2024 — I think the thing that we have to take away from the last 10 years is that we really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power. ""I was talking about this with someone earlier today, where, you remember there was some threat that congressional or Senate Republicans made, ‘If you get rid of the filibuster, we’re gonna do X, Y and Z.’ And you actually look at it, it’s like, well this is, this is not that interesting. Like — ""  Domenech, laughing:  ""We’re going to actually deliver on the promises we’ve made for decades.""  Vance:  ""Right? You know, this is the threat? ‘If you get rid of the filibuster we’re going to do this stuff?’ They’re talking about expanding the Supreme Court; they’re talking about adding two senators from heavily Democratic places."" …  Vance : ""So, I think, I mean, look. I am a cynic about this and maybe even a little bit of a pessimist. But I think the challenge confronting American conservatives is that we have lost every major powerful institution in the country, except for maybe churches and religious institutions, which of course are weaker now than they’ve ever been. We’ve lost big business, we’ve lost finance, we’ve lost the culture, we’ve lost the economy. And if we’re going to really, actually affect real change in the country it will require us completely replacing the existing ruling class with another ruling class. I say that, knowing and hearing myself — it sounds really hard. It is really hard. But I don’t think there’s, like a detente with these people. I don't think there’s sort of a compromise that we’re going to come with the people who currently actually control the country. Unless we overthrow them in some way, we’re going to keep losing. And that’s the challenge. Now, it’s not easy. It requires us to build institutions. It requires us to support, you know, alternative media institutions and alternative media programs. It requires us to elect different people at all levels of government. And it requires us to be willing to use the power vested in our constitutional republic to go after some of our enemies in big business. Those things are all really hard, but I don’t know how else to do it."" Vance mentioned neither Project 2025 nor The Heritage Foundation in the interview; it would be two more years before the plan would be published. Asked for evidence of its claim, Harris’ campaign said the video showed Vance voicing support for policies similar to those promoted in Project 2025. The campaign also pointed to Vance’s remarks about Project 2025 and his affiliations with its contributors. For example, part of Project 2025 calls for extensive executive-branch overhauls, including  reclassifying  thousands of civil servants as  political appointees , therefore  increasing the number  of federal workers who  would advance conservative goals . This aligns with a  strategy Vance promoted  in 2021.  But this lacks context, too. Democrats have linked  Project 2025 to former President Donald Trump  when attacking its proposals, but the Heritage Foundation-produced guide is neither an official Trump campaign position nor the  Republican party platform . Although both Trump and Vance have expressed some views that align with some of the policy proposals laid out in Project 2025, neither have issued a blanket endorsement of the plan. Trump has rebutted attacks tying him to Project 2025,  saying  he knows ""nothing about it"" and has ""no idea who is behind it."" On July 30, the Heritage Foundation  said  the project’s director, Paul Dans, would  step down . Vance has expressed support from some — but not all — of the ideas Project 2025 promotes. ""I think most Americans couldn’t care less about Project 2025,"" Vance said during a July  Newsmax interview . ""I’ve reviewed a lot of it. There’s some good ideas in there, Rob, there’s some things that I disagree with. But most importantly, it has no affiliation with the Trump campaign."" Vance has some ties to The Heritage Foundation. He wrote the  foreword  for an upcoming book  written  by the Heritage Foundation’s president, Kevin Roberts, who is an  architect  and  promoter  of Project 2025. Vance spoke at the Heritage Foundation’s 50th Anniversary Leadership Summit in April 2023, when he  said  that if Republicans won the White House in 2024, ""This organization is going to play a major role in helping us figure out how to govern."" We contacted Vance’s office and received no reply.  Harris’ campaign claimed a video it posted on X showed that ""JD Vance endorses Project 2025.""  The video was posted in May 2021, nearly two years before Project 2025’s 922-page conservative policy guide was published in April 2023.  Vance did not mention nor endorse Project 2025 then.

Trump tried to double down on Truth Social after the event,  sharing a video  of Harris with Indian actress Mindy Kaling, in which Harris says she is Indian. The video isn’t evidence that she didn’t also identify with her Black heritage. This is a false mischaracterization of Harris’ background and heritage, and how she has spoken about, and identified with, her race and ethnicity.   Trump’s attack isn’t new, and harks to the  ""birtherism"" conspiracies  he and others baselessly pushed about former President Barack Obama for years. Harris, born of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, has identified as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural household. These kinds of claims reflect a poor understanding of history and the fluid nature and various interpretations of racial identity in the United States, race and politics experts say. ""The approach to Harris in this instance, the attempt to ‘other’ her, is a common practice in American politics,"" said Keneshia Grant, a political science professor at Howard University. ""These tactics will continue because they work. People have to prepare themselves to check their own biases and fears and use logic and facts to guide their decision-making when these kinds of attacks occur."" The Harris campaign sent PolitiFact  its statement  on Trump’s NABJ appearance. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who is Black, called the comments  ""repulsive"" and ""insulting."" The Trump campaign did not respond with evidence to support his assertions. Harris is the daughter of an immigrant mother from India, Shyamala Gopalan, and an immigrant father from Jamaica, Donald Harris. She grew up in a  Black middle-class neighborhood  in Berkeley, California, where her parents would often join civil rights protests. Donald Harris immigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica after he got into the University of California, Berkeley, Kamala Harris wrote in her 2019 autobiography,  ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey.""  Shyamala Harris was born in Chennai, India, and moved to California after graduating from the University of Delhi to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology at Berkeley. The couple separated when Harris was 5 and divorced a few years later, Harris wrote in her book. Kamala Harris lived in California until she was in middle school, when she moved to Montreal after her mother was offered a teaching position at McGill University. Harris attended college at Howard University, an historically Black university, in Washington, D.C., and earned her law degree at the University of California, Hastings in 1989. Harris has embraced her Black identity and multicultural background in several ways. When she was at Howard University, Harris pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority. As a U.S. senator, Harris was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, supporting her colleagues’ legislation to strengthen voting rights and policing reforms. The New York Times  in 2020  spoke with some of Harris’ high school classmates from Montreal. They told reporters Harris identified as Black back then, too, while navigating complicated racial and social divisions at the school. ""In high school, you were either in the white or the Black group,"" Wanda Kagan, her best friend from Westmount High School, who had a white mother and a Black father,  told the Times . ""We didn’t fit exactly into either, so we made ourselves fit into both."" Although Harris was able to navigate her intersectionality, Kagan told the newspaper that ""she identified as being African-American"" and found belonging in the Black community there, adding that she and Harris would attend Black community dance parties and gripe about having to be home by 11 p.m. In 2007,  when questions arose about former President Barack Obama’s Blackness as he ran for president, Harris, then San Francisco’s district attorney, said many Americans have a limited perception of Black people. ""We are diverse and multifaceted,"" Harris said. ""People are bombarded with stereotypical images and so they are limited in their ability to imagine our capacity."" In 2010,  when Harris was months away from being elected as California’s attorney general, one story described her as being raised in a Black neighborhood, where she attended Black churches, but also worshiped in her mother’s Hindu temple and had made visits to her family in India. ""Running for office, you have to simplify or condense or put into preexisting boxes who you are, so people will have a sense of you based on what they easily and quickly identify,"" Harris said. ""I grew up in a family where I had a strong sense of my culture and who I am, and I never felt insecure about that at all. Slowly, perhaps, with each of us taking on more prominent positions, people will start to understand the diversity of the people."" Harris told  The Washington Post in 2019  that she identifies as ""an American,"" and that she’s been comfortable with her identity from an early age, something she credits to her Hindu immigrant single mother, who adopted Black culture and immersed her daughters in it. Harris said she grew up embracing her Indian culture while proudly living as a Black girl. She said the same in her book. She told the Post that she hasn’t spent much time dwelling on how to categorize herself, but being forced to define herself was more of a struggle when she first ran for office. When Harris and President Joe Biden campaigned together as running mates in summer 2020, they highlighted the historic nature of Harris’ candidacy: the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to be nominated for national office by a major party in the United States. Trump said Harris was Indian and then ""made a turn"" and ""became a Black person."" This is blatant mischaracterization of Harris’ heritage and how she has spoken about, and has identified with, her racial background and ethnicity. Harris, born of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, has long identified as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural household. She attended a historically Black university, pledged an historically Black sorority, and has given interviews and written about her experience embracing her Indian culture while living as a Black woman.

politifact,Biden Executive Order 14019  “requires our taxpayer-funded federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act and engage in illegal vote harvesting.”,"The National Voter Registration Act, passed in 1993, states that voter registration agencies may include federal offices.      Executive Order 14019 states that when agencies carry out the order, all applicable laws must be followed.      The order does not command federal agencies to collect ballots.","A New York lawmaker has joined other Republicans taking fresh aim at a 3-year-old executive order from President Biden. U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney claims the order violates the law limiting federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity and requires federal offices to illegally collect ballots.  Experts on election law say that’s a false interpretation of Biden’s order which was designed to promote information about voter registration. Tenney, a Republican seeking re-election in a district that reaches from the North Country into Western New York,  claimed on Facebook  that Biden's  executive order  ""requires our taxpayer-funded federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act and engage in illegal vote harvesting."" The  Hatch Act  limits partisan political activity by federal employees and by state and local employees who deliver federally funded programs during work hours and bans them from using government offices and resources.  We wondered how this order could require federal employees to engage in partisan political activity and illegally harvest votes.  ""Ballot harvesting""  or ""vote harvesting"" is a term often used by people in a pejorative way to refer to collecting completed absentee ballots and submitting them. Some voting rights experts see the term ""ballot harvesting"" as pejorative and prefer the term ""ballot collection.""  Many states  allow at least certain individuals to collect some ballots on behalf of others. Biden signed Executive Order 14019  on March 7, 2021. It builds on a 1993 law, the  National Voter Registration Act , which aimed to expand opportunities for eligible voters to register at places such as military recruiting offices, state motor vehicle departments and federal agencies.  The National Voter Registration Act specifies that voter registration activities must be nonpartisan and that the ""person providing assistance at a voter registration agency cannot attempt to influence an applicant’s political preference or party registration"" or make an applicant believe that public benefits or services are dependent on decisions related to their registration, according to the  Congressional Research Service .  Biden’s order states that ""the head of each agency shall evaluate ways in which the agency can, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, promote voter registration and voter participation."" These activities include updating websites and other public-facing materials with information on how to register to vote, how to request a vote-by-mail ballot, and how to cast a ballot in upcoming elections, and pointing visitors to their own states’ election information.  A state can request that federal agencies be designated voter registration agencies, under the order, and states must approve of any such designation. Military recruitment offices are already voter registration agencies  under the National Voter Registration Act.   We approached Tenney’s office for evidence of her claim, and a spokesperson told us the executive order directs federal agencies, who employ political appointees, to promote access to voting. The  Hatch Act  prohibits civil service employees in the executive branch from engaging in political activity, and by using civil service employees to ""handpick"" who they register to vote, the Biden administration is engaging in illegal vote harvesting, she said.    Experts we spoke with said the order does not violate the Hatch Act and does not lead to vote harvesting.  ""The order has nothing to do with ‘ballot harvesting,’ in any way that term could be defined,"" said  David J. Becker , executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonpartisan organization that works with election officials from both political parties. ""It is merely an order authorizing federal agencies to cooperate with the states to provide voter registration opportunities to all citizens through those agencies.""    Harvesting can be a scary word, conjuring up images of collecting ballots from people against their will or collecting fraudulent ballots. But ballot distribution and collection is still run by the states under this order, said Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization that promotes voting. Trevor Potter, a Republican and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, founded the legal center.  ""This is not directing federal agencies to do anything in support of a candidate or party or ballot initiative,"" Diaz said.  The U.S. Office of Special Counsel issued two opinions in the early 2000s   about whether voter registration drives in federal offices violate the Hatch Act. The office has found that registration drives organized by nonpartisan organizations are  allowed . Partisan drives, those with a goal of helping a party or candidate,  are not allowed .  ""Nonpartisan voter registration is not partisan, and therefore is not a problem under the Hatch Act,"" said  Sean Morales-Doyle , director of the Voting Rights Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.  Tenney claimed that Executive Order 14019 ""requires our taxpayer-funded federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act and engage in illegal vote harvesting."" Her use of the words ""requires"" and ""violate"" are not suggestions of what the order could do. They are strong words, but they are wrong.   The order calls on federal agencies to expand voter registration activities and to do so within the bounds of the law. The Hatch Act prohibits partisan political activities in government offices. Promoting voter registration to would-be eligible voters who come in contact with federal agencies is not a partisan activity. The order does not require federal agencies to violate the Hatch Act.  The order also does not call for federal agencies to collect any ballots, so the claim of illegal vote harvesting is baseless.  This statement makes a ridiculous claim, and we rate it Pants on Fire!",pants-fire,Claudia Tenney,2024-07-03,2024-08-02,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Man_in_Chicago_fills_out_voter_registration_form_10-11-20_AP/12c1f7621b924b495feef4fd388160b7.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/02/claudia-tenney/executive-order-to-expand-voter-registration-calls/,"Elections, New York, Claudia Tenney"
politifact,“Nowhere on her birth certificate does it say that she is BLACK OR AFRICAN. …  Kamala Harris is NOT black and never has been.”,"Kamala Harris’ birth certificate, issued in 1964, does not describe her race.     It lists her mother as being from India and lists her ""color or race"" as Caucasian. It lists her father as being from Jamaica and his ""color or race"" as Jamaican. Though it doesn’t say so on the certificate, her father, Donald J. Harris, is a Black man.     Throughout her public life, Kamala Harris has identified herself as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural home.","After former President Donald Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial identity July 31 at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, some of his supporters used social media to echo his  baseless claim  that she hasn’t identified as Black until recently. Laura Loomer, a conservative activist, shared a copy of what she said was Harris’ birth certificate in a  July 31 X post  and wrote, ""Nowhere on her birth certificate does it say that she is BLACK OR AFRICAN. @KamalaHQ is a liar. Donald Trump is correct. Kamala Harris is NOT black and never has been."" Loomer shared a  similar post  on Truth Social, which Trump reshared. We contacted Loomer for more evidence to support her claim and she said, ""Jamaican is a nationality. Not a race. You do understand there are white Jamaicans right? Nowhere does it say she’s black."" ""Her birth certificate says Caucasian and Jamaican. Can you tell me where on that birth certificate it says she’s black? Or are you preparing to lie and say that all Jamaicans are black?"" Loomer added. The birth certificate does not address Kamala Harris’ race. She has long identified as a Black woman throughout her life and political career and also embraces her Indian heritage.  The version of the birth certificate Loomer shared matches one that was published  online  in August 2020 by the Bay Area News Group to accompany a San Jose Mercury News  article  about her eligibility to be vice president. That version of the birth certificate shows Harris’ father, Donald Harris, was born in Jamaica and her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. In a box that says ""color or race"" of the mother and father, it listed ""Caucasian"" for Gopalan and ""Jamaican"" for Donald Harris. There is no box for the child’s race. The birth certificate in Loomer’s post is an ""informational copy"" that anyone can request. It can’t be used for identification, as a ""certified copy"" can. Those copies contain the same information, with some possible redactions on the informational copy. Both are considered ""certified"" copies, the  California Department of Public Health said . The state also keeps a confidential section of a birth record that is only available to certain people, and includes medical and social information such as ""race, occupation and medical data,"" that is often used for public health or research purposes, a  California Department of Public Health website  about obtaining a birth certificate copy said.  The confidential portion of Harris’ birth certificate did not contain more specific information about her parents’ race, as that information was on the public portion, the department said. State law says only the person named on the birth certificate, the parent who signed it, or if no parent signed it, the mother, or a person who has petitioned to adopt the child named on the certificate, may request this confidential copy. The state’s current certificate of live birth also doesn’t collect information on the race or ethnicity of the child. Previous versions collected information specified by law over the years, but the child’s race hasn’t been a field on recent birth records, including in 1964, the health department said in an email to PolitiFact after publication of this story.  A blank version of California’s current live birth certificate provided to PolitiFact has boxes for the birthplace of parents, but no box for their race. In the confidential section, there’s a box to list whether a parent is ""Hispanic, Latino or Spanish"" and another to list up to three races or ethnicities. It does not have a box for the race of the child. The birth certificate does not list Kamala Harris’ race, but that doesn’t tell us anything about her racial identity. It also doesn’t mention Donald Harris’ race, but he is Black. Attacks about racial identity and ethnicity  have followed  Harris throughout her political career. Conservatives have recently revived  baseless birther accusations  that Harris is ineligible to be president because her parents were not U.S. citizens. (To be clear: She was born in the U.S. and is eligible to be president.) It’s true, as Loomer said, that Jamaican is a nationality, not a race. However, the vast majority of Jamacians (92.1%) are Black, according to a  2011 Population and Housing Census report . That report showed that about 0.16% of Jamaica’s 2.6 million-person-plus  population is white. A more recent population Census that began in 2022  has not been finalized . Genetic  studies  have shown that the vast majority of Jamacians descended from people from sub-Saharan Africa. The African diaspora refers to many communities of people of African descent dispersed throughout the world through historic movements, including slavery. About 15 million African men, women and children were kidnapped from their homelands and sold into enslavement throughout the Americas and the Caribbean. Experts told PolitiFact in  an earlier story  that people who say Jamaican people are not African ignore slavery’s global reach. ""Slavery impacted many people from Africa, and we went to many places,"" Howard University political science professor Keneshia Grant said. ""Harris’ father’s people got dropped off in Jamaica. Mine got dropped off in Haiti. The African diaspora is huge, and it is worldwide, so to suggest that a Jamaican is not African, or connected to Africa is not acknowledging the vestiges of slavery."" Harris’ Jamaican-born father, Donald Harris, became the first Black scholar to gain tenure in Stanford University’s economics department,  The New York Times   and  The Washington Post  have reported. In a  2018 essay  about sharing his Jamaican roots with his daughters, Donald Harris lamented court-appointed limits in his custody battle for his daughters, sarcastically writing that they were ""based on the false assumption by the State of California that fathers cannot handle parenting (especially in the case of this father, ""a neegroe from da eyelans"" was the Yankee stereotype, who might just end up eating his children for breakfast!)."" Kamala Harris  in a 2003 profile  in AsianWeekly, referred to her father as ""a Black man."" We contacted Donald Harris and Kamala Harris’ campaign but did not immediately receive a response. Harris has long identified publicly as a Black woman who grew up in a multicultural household. In her 2019 autobiography,  ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey ,"" Harris wrote that she and her sister, Maya, were ""raised with a strong awareness of and an appreciation for Indian culture."" She added that her ""mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters"" and was determined that they ""would grow into confident, proud black women."" Harris moved from California to Montreal when she was in middle school when her mother, by then separated from Kamala’s father, took a teaching position there.  In high school, Harris identified as Black, some of her classmates  told The New York Times  in 2020. Harris returned to the U.S. to attend Howard University, a historically Black university, in Washington, D.C., and later earned her law degree at the University of California, Hastings in 1989. At Howard, Harris pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority. As a senator, Harris was in the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout her political career, Harris has identified herself as a Black woman who also embraced her South Asian heritage.  Her official California attorney general  biography  said she was ""the first African American woman and South Asian American woman in California to hold the office."" Her official White House  biography  said she was the ""first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American"" to be elected as vice president. In a 2019  interview  on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show, Harris said, ""I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black. And I was born Black. I will die Black."" Loomer claimed a birth certificate proves Harris is not Black and never has been because it doesn’t say she is Black or African. But Harris’ birth certificate did not include information about her race. The certificate did list her parents’ birthplace and ""color or race."" Her mother, born in India, listed ""Caucasian"" and her father, a Black man born in Jamaica, listed ""Jamaican.""  The certificate does not say Kamala Harris is Black, nor does it say she is not.  Harris has long identified as a Black woman who also embraced her Indian heritage. The claim that a birth certificate that doesn’t assign a race to her is proof that she’s not Black is False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact-check.

Of the state’s roughly  5.7 million  population, as of 2021,  86,610 were Somali , reports Minnesota Compass, a  research project  led by Wilder Research.  A new state flag  adopted May 11  has for months been the subject of online  misinformation  from critics who say it  resembles  the Somali flag or regional flags from that country. Many of those  claims  were based on proposed Minnesota flag designs and  not on the state flag’s final design . Since Harris announced Aug. 6 that Walz would join the Democratic ticket, we  found  multiple social media  posts  reviving false  claims  about the new Minnesota flag and its supposed  resemblances  to Somalia flags. The  Somalia national flag  has a light-blue background with a five-pointed white star in the center. The  Minnesota state flag  features a white, eight-pointed star on a dark blue background on the left, and light blue coloring on the right.  The Somalia national flag, left, and the Minnesota state flag. (Embassy of Somalia-USA, Minnesota State Emblems Redesign Commission) Although both flags have stars and similar colors, as do many flags, Somalia’s flag did not serve as an inspiration for Minnesota’s,  Andrew Prekker , a Minnesota man whose flag concept inspired the final design, told PolitiFact. And Walz played no role in the new flag’s design. Minnesota’s Legislature in 2023 established the  State Emblems Redesign Commission  to replace the state’s flag and seal. The state flag  had been in use since 1957  and featured a Native American riding away on horseback while a white settler plowed his field — a design  considered offensive  by some of the state’s Native American population because it symbolized their displacement. The  new flag  was chosen after a monthslong selection process that drew 2,128 design entries.  ""Governor Walz did not have a seat on the commission and did not have approval over the flag design or adoption,"" Cassondra Knudson, a spokesperson for Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon — a voting member of the commission — told PolitiFact in an email.  Walz appointed three of the commission’s 13 voting members, including its vice chair. A Walz spokesperson did not return a request for comment. The governor has criticized the state’s old flag as ""problematic."" He said of the new flag, ""We've evolved into a more diverse state and I think it's more reflective of that,"" according to a May  report by WCCO-TV , a  CBS News affiliate. . Simon,  in a December commission meeting  before the final design was chosen, spoke about complaints about the flag design proposals’ resemblance to other countries’ flags; he noted that Iowa’s state flag bears a resemblance to the French flag and Texas’ state flag is similar to Chile’s.  Prekker said in a May 19  Instagram post  that it’s his ""greatest hope that all Minnesotans — including those within our Tribal nations and indigenous communities — feel represented by the flag."" Prekker’s winning design entry included horizontal white, green and light blue stripes to the right of a white, eight-pointed star on a blue background. He said in a  statement accompanying his entry  that the navy blue on the left was the abstract shape of Minnesota and the star in the navy blue represented the state’s motto: ""L'etoile du Nord, meaning ""star of the north,""and also represents a symbol of unity above a land of diversity."" A flag from Somalia’s Jubaland state seen in the  X post  we are checking bears a resemblance to Prekker’s original concept with horizontal green, blue and white stripes, and a five-pointed star in blue on the left side. The horizontal stripes representing snow and agriculture that Prekker proposed were removed in the final design. Andrew Prekker’s design that was used to create the final version of Minnesota’s state flag. (State Emblems Redesign Committee) Prekker told PolitiFact that Walz ""has nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia has nothing to do with the flag design."" Prekker said he submitted three flag designs and used only other U.S. state flags for inspiration, not flags of other countries. ""Somalia had absolutely nothing to do with my flag during any point in the creation process,"" he said. Prekker said he and the selection committee, with the help of others, revised the North Star on his design to be a north-facing ""selburose star,"" which has more relevance to the state’s history as it is seen in Indigenous people’s art and is also on the floor of the Minnesota State Capitol’s rotunda. The white and green horizontal stripes were removed because they cluttered the design, which allowed the flag to better ""focus on what's really unique about Minnesota: our waters,"" he said. The final design based on Prekker’s concept has an eight-pointed star that represents the North Star, surrounded by a dark blue field that represents the night sky and the state’s shape, the Redesign Commission said in  its final report  to the governor and Legislature. The right side of the flag is a light blue field that represents the state’s ""abundance of water,"" noting that Minnesota has 11,842 lakes and 6,564 rivers and streams. ""A hundred flags have the color blue and some form of a white star. There is zero connection to Somalia or any other country,"" Prekker said. ""Any similarities people want to see are a coincidence. It is a Minnesotan flag, and that is what I designed it for."" Anita Gaul, the Redesign Commission's vice chair, said the flag design had nothing at all to do with Somalia.  There is no reference to Somalia or the state’s Somali population in the commission’s report describing what each of the flag’s elements represent. The star ""also represents many cultures over time and across the globe,"" the report said, adding that the star ""has been used extensively in quilting by both Indigenous people and some new immigrants."" An X post claims Walz changed the Minnesota flag to resemble Somalia’s flag. But Walz played no role in a state commission’s monthslong process to choose a new design for the state flag and logo, other than appointing three commission members. The flag’s design was not created with Somalia in mind, according to a state commission's report, its vice chair and the creator whose design inspired the final version.

politifact,"Eric Hovde “wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and kick millions off their health insurance.”","In comments from 2024, 2017 and 2012, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde said he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act     Hovde’s website calls for health care reform, but not explicitly repealing the act.      Hovde does not lay out specifics for an alternative plan, but said in June he wants to keep protections for preexisting conditions.","It’s been around for well over a decade, but it’s still a hot topic in congressional campaigns in 2024: the Affordable Care Act.  That’s true in the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin faces Republican challenger Eric Hovde. ""My opponent wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick millions off their health insurance,"" Baldwin  said  July 23 at Vice President Kamala Harris’  first presidential campaign rally in West Allis .  She’s made similar claims before, including in a  post on the social media platform X  that has nearly a quarter of a million views.  Does Hovde want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare? And has his position on the issue changed over the years? Let’s take a look.  When we asked Baldwin’s campaign for backup, communications director Andrew Mamo shared a memo with Hovde’s comments about the Affordable Care Act from 2024, 2017 and 2012.  The most recent of those examples was in June of this year, when Hovde was interviewed by  WMTV 15 , a Madison television station.  ""Would you want to repeal the Affordable Care Act?"" the reporter asked.  ""Oh, 100%. I think we need to change the Affordable Care Act,"" Hovde answered.  Hovde added the ""only thing I think that was worthy in that bill was pre-existing conditions. So, I believe in supporting and keeping pre-existing conditions."" Hovde is referring to the part of the act  that says  insurers can’t refuse to cover or charge more when people have preexisting conditions: such as multiple sclerosis, which Hovde was  diagnosed with in 1991 .  Baldwin’s campaign also shared clips of Hovde’s remarks in 2017, when he said he would have voted for  two Republican bills  that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act.  ""You should push it through. You should get it done because it’s a vast improvement (to) where we are. But is it a perfect bill, absolutely not,"" Hovde told conservative radio host Jerry Bader on WTAQ in June 2017. And in 2012, when he was running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Hovde made multiple comments that he’d repeal the law.  One of those instances was during an  interview  with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board, in which Hovde said he’d repeal the ACA ""in its entirety."" ""I think we need to move back to a free-market approach to solve a lot of these problems. I think we need to break up the mini-monopolies in every single state,"" Hovde said. While those are statements from the past, his comments from June indicate he still wants to repeal the ACA. Meanwhile, PolitiFact Wisconsin reached the Hovde campaign, but they didn’t have anything to add from his most recent interview on the matter. But we can glean more information from Hovde’s campaign website, where he lists health care reform as one of his  top four issues , along with the cost of living, immigration and foreign policy. On the  health care page , Hovde doesn’t explicitly say he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, rather that the health care system is ""deeply flawed and in need of reform."" The webpage ""has many inaccurate statements and misrepresentations of data,"" said Donna Friedsam, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies health care policy and reform.  To be clear, we’re fact-checking Baldwin here, not Hovde. But it’s important context for understanding why he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  For example, prescription drug prices did not ""skyrocket,"" as Hovde asserts on the website.  The average price of a prescription has not increased considerably in recent years, Friedsam said, pointing to a  Congressional Budget Office analysis  from 2022.   That’s partly because of rebate discounts and lower-cost generic drugs that offset rising prices for brand names.  Finally, Hovde also doesn’t lay out specifics of an alternative plan he wants to see.  His June comments indicated he wants to keep protections for preexisting conditions, but there’s not much more information on his campaign website.  Finally, let’s look at the last part of Baldwin’s claim, that ""millions"" would get kicked off their health insurance if the ACA is repealed.  PolitiFact has examined a similar claim before , when Biden said over a hundred million Americans would lose protections for preexisting conditions if former President Donald Trump repealed the law.  Baldwin’s campaign pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a  2023 fact sheet  from the White House.  The White House cited a Congressional Budget Office estimate from 2017 that found the Republican repeal legislation would ""grow the ranks of the uninsured by 23 million."" And the number of people with some type of Affordable Care Act coverage has grown since 2017, the White House noted. They put the number at 40 million people whose insurance would be at risk.  The picture is a bit complicated when estimating what would happen if the ACA was repealed. But Baldwin does seem on par that millions would lose their insurance or be at risk.   Baldwin said Hovde ""wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and kick millions off their health insurance."" Hovde made comments in the past, and as recently as June, that he does want to repeal the law. He calls for health care reform on his website, but doesn’t explicitly call for repealing the ACA.  That website also contains inaccuracies and misrepresentations about the ACA, according to a health care expert that reviewed it. Hovde doesn’t lay out an alternative plan.  We rate Baldwin’s claim True. ",true,Tammy Baldwin,2024-07-23,2024-08-07,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP_17083832241010/c4f7c5d7c407024aae55e72740c6998f.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/07/tammy-baldwin/does-gop-senate-candidate-eric-hovde-want-to-repea/,"National, Elections, Health Care, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Tammy Baldwin"
politifact,Donald Trump “intends to cut” Medicare.,"Former President Donald Trump has said repeatedly during the 2024 presidential campaign that he will not cut Medicare.     During his presidency, Trump released four successive annual budgets that proposed cutting Medicare. However, experts are divided on how much those cuts would have hurt beneficiaries had they been enacted.","On the campaign trail, both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have painted former President Donald Trump as a threat to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for all Americans older than 65.  A little more than a week after becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris said during a July 30 rally in Atlanta, ""Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare."" We previously rated Harris’ comments about Trump cutting Social Security  Mostly False . Here, we’ll examine her statement about Medicare. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly said he would not cut Medicare.  As president, though, Trump regularly proposed policies that would have reduced Medicare spending. Policy experts disagree about whether Medicare beneficiaries would have borne the brunt of those cuts. ""It’s difficult to know with any certainty what Donald Trump’s agenda for Medicare would be, given the lack of specificity in his platform and the vagueness of phrases like ‘strengthen Medicare’ and ‘protect Medicare,’"" said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health care policy think tank. ""While his campaign platform rules out cuts to Medicare, that could still leave the door open for changes to Medicare that might not look like cuts but that would fundamentally transform the defined-benefit nature of the program.""  Defined-benefit programs automatically pay member benefits. In defined-contribution plans, the opposite happens —  beneficiaries receive a fixed amount of money from which they must cover all their costs, even if that means members may pay excess costs out of pocket. In his 2024 campaign, Trump has made clear that his Medicare policy is to make no cuts. On Jan. 20, 2023, as part of a series of policy statements called Agenda 47, Trump posted, ""Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security."" He reiterated this stance in the Republican Party  platform  released earlier this year. In the platform summary, he promised to ""fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts."" The party’s full  platform document  added that the goal is to ""protect Medicare, and ensure seniors receive the care they need without being burdened by excessive costs."" When contacted for comment, Harris’ campaign pointed PolitiFact to a variety of proposals for Medicare then-president Trump included in his annual budget proposals, some of which can be characterized as cuts. As with many presidential budget proposals, generally, Trump’s Medicare proposals were not enacted. As president, Trump submitted four successive proposed budgets, covering fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Trump proposed  eliminating  Medicare State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, which advise Medicare recipients on how to sign up for benefits and manage billing disputes. He also proposed  raising  premiums and  charging beneficiaries more  for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D; and  limiting payments  to nursing homes and home health agencies. ""Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello told PolitiFact. ""Trump’s own record makes clear that he will gut critical benefits for millions of Americans if he takes power."" However, other policies Trump advocated for were aimed at curbing spending on providers, not reducing patients’ benefits. This broad goal, and sometimes these specific proposals, have often received  bipartisan   support . ""In general, these proposals are in areas where there is evidence we pay providers too much,"" Matthew Fiedler, of the Brookings Institution Center for Health Policy,  told  PolitiFact in 2019.  In analyzing Trump’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — a group supporting lower deficits —  concluded  that Trump’s Medicare policies that year ""would not represent reductions in benefits, but instead reductions in cost for roughly the same level of benefits."" On balance, the group said that Trump’s policies ""would actually reduce costs for individuals by lowering premiums and out-of-pocket costs."" Project 2025 is a 922-page policy guide for an incoming Republican administration assembled by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, along with other conservative groups.  Democrats have sought to link  Project 2025 to Trump , and while the former president has expressed views that align with some of the project’s policy proposals, Project 2025 is distinct from Trump’s official campaign positions and from the  Republican Party platform . Trump has  rebutted efforts  to tie him to it. The blueprint, published in  2023 , says it would make the privately run Medicare option, called Medicare Advantage, the default choice for beneficiaries; increase competitive bidding for services; and ease regulations on prescription drugs, hospice care and medical savings accounts. Experts told PolitiFact that if Trump followed these recommendations, it would not necessarily result in cuts for beneficiaries. ""Policymakers and researchers disagree on whether the reforms outlined in the Project 2025 report would work, and whether there could be adverse consequences,"" said Christine Eibner, a senior economist on health care policy for Rand, a think tank. She added that the same could be said about the policy efforts proposed by the Biden administration. ""While such changes would aim to cut spending, they wouldn’t necessarily reduce beneficiaries’ access to care — although the devil is in the details,"" Eibner said. Joe Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said the specific policies urged by Project 2025 are largely in line with past ideas to make Medicare more efficient. ""Simplistic claims from either party about Medicare or their opponent's plans are not useful and generally are misleading,"" Antos said. Harris said Trump ""intends to cut"" Medicare. Trump has made clear in speeches and written policy documents during the 2024 campaign that he has no plans to cut Medicare. The Harris campaign points to Trump’s four successive annual budgets in which he proposed policies that could be described as cutting Medicare. However, experts disagree about whether those cuts would have hurt beneficiaries had they been enacted. Some of Trump’s proposed cuts were aimed at curbing spending on providers, a goal that has bipartisan support.

politifact,Kamala Harris “supports mandatory gun confiscation.”,"Kamala Harris, as a 2019 presidential primary candidate, said, ""I support a mandatory gun buyback program"" for assault weapons. We found no examples that she supports mandatory gun confiscation now and the majority of guns sold in the U.S. are handguns.     Former President Trump used the present tense when he said that Harris ""supports mandatory gun confiscation."" The Harris campaign told The New York Times that she supports banning assault weapons but not requiring their sale to the federal government.      As vice president, Harris has urged states to pass red flag laws and supported federal gun safety legislation that included funding for mental health and school security resources.","Former President Donald Trump told supporters in Georgia that Vice President Kamala Harris will take away their guns and leave them ""totally defenseless in your house."" ""She supports mandatory gun confiscation,"" Trump  said  Aug. 3 at a campaign rally in Atlanta. He added sarcastically, ""Would anybody mind if they came into your house and took away your gun? …  She's for taking away all of your guns."" In July, we saw similar statements about Harris’ gun record from the  NRA ,  Gun Owners of America  and  Dave McCormick , a Pennsylvania Republican running for U.S. Senate. The phrase ""gun confiscation"" is broad and could lead voters to think that Harris wants to confiscate all guns from law-abiding owners. That’s not what she has said. Further, those rights are constitutionally protected by the Second Amendment. In the U.S. gun buybacks are programs organized by local police departments that  voluntarily  allow people to turn over their guns in exchange for something, such as a gift card. While running in the presidential primary in 2019, the then-California senator  said  she supported a ""mandatory gun buyback program"" for assault weapons. It did not apply to all guns, and she no longer holds that position. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Harris addressed gun buybacks several times during the 2019 campaign. During an  October 2019 gun control forum in Las Vegas , Harris joined two primary rivals in supporting the mandatory buyback of assault weapons.  ""We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory gun buyback program,"" Harris said. ""It’s got to be smart, we got to do it the right way. But there are 5 million (assault weapons) at least, some estimate as many as 10 million, and we’re going to have to have smart public policy that’s about taking those off the streets, but doing it the right way."" Assault weapons are not the majority of guns sold in the U.S. Handguns are the most popular. A  1994 federal assault weapons ban , which expired in 2004, barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. Harris has supported renewing the ban  throughout her career . In November 2019,  NBC News  also reported that Harris then supported a ""mandatory gun buyback."" Harris told the interviewer that ""there is no place"" for assault weapons on the streets. NBC News’ Harry Smith asked Harris, ""So, say you’ve got a couple hundred thousand off the streets, I mean, isn’t that just a drop in the bucket? Harris said: ""Well, what we’ll do is have an incentive for people to turn them in and buy them back. But when we`re talking about weapons of war, I mean, it literally is this simple. Five million assault weapons on the streets of America, period."" The Trump campaign in an  X post  highlighted Harris’ response to a college student’s question in a September  2019 episode  of ""The Tonight Show"" starring Jimmy Fallon. One student asked Harris, ""Do you believe in mandatory buy back of quote unquote ‘assault weapons’ and whether or not you do, how does that idea not go against fundamentally the Second Amendment?"" In its  video clip  of Harris, the Trump campaign included a couple of sentences of Harris’ remarks. We put the parts that the Trump campaign included in the video in bold: Harris said:  ""I do believe that we need to do buybacks.""  Then she described assault weapons as ""weapons of war."" She vowed if elected to ""ban on the importation of assault weapons"" and said that the U.S. will have to deal with the assault weapons that are already in the country.  ""And, so,  a buyback program is a good idea, now we need to do it the right way and part of that has to be buy back and give people their value the financial value  of what they have and not just take things from people that have value without compensating them. We need to do it the right way,"" she said. During an  April 2019 CNN town hall , Harris referred to her time as state attorney general and said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns from people who were found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others.  ""I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing,"" Harris said. ""We’re talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues."" In April 2019, Harris  told reporters  in Iowa, ""We are being offered a false choice. You’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away. It’s a false choice that is born out of a lack of courage from leaders who must recognize and agree that there are some practical solutions to what is a clear problem in our country."" We asked the Harris campaign whether she still supports mandatory assault weapons buybacks. She does not. A campaign spokesperson pointed to a comment the campaign gave to  The New York Times  that, like President Joe Biden, Harris wants to ban assault weapons but not require people to sell them to the federal government. We found no statements by Harris during calling for mass gun confiscation during her vice presidency. As vice president, Harris has urged states to pass  red flag laws  and supported federal gun safety legislation that included funding for mental health and school security resources. None of that is akin to gun confiscation.  Trump said Harris ""supports mandatory gun confiscation.""  While running in the 2019 presidential primary, Harris said, ""I support a mandatory gun buyback program"" for assault weapons. This would not cover all guns; handguns, for example, are the most popular. Trump used the present tense when he said that Harris ""supports mandatory gun confiscation."" The Harris campaign told The New York Times that she supports banning assault weapons but not a requirement to sell them to the federal government. We could find no examples that she currently supports mandatory gun confiscation. The claim contains an element of truth about her past position on assault weapons, but it leaves a misleading impression about her platform in 2024. We rate this statement Mostly False.

politifact,"During the 2020 Minnesota riots after George Floyd’s murder, Gov. Tim Walz didn’t call in the National Guard, “so, I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis.”","Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order May 28, 2020, calling up the Minnesota National Guard to respond to riots.     Shortly after the order, the National Guard said that it was assigning and preparing units to respond.     President Donald Trump spoke to Walz hours after Walz’s order. Trump offered assistance.","Former President Donald Trump said during a recent Minnesota rally that it was he — not Gov. Tim Walz — who ordered the National Guard to respond to Minneapolis riots in 2020. ""Every voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago, remember me?"" Trump said at his  July 27 St. Cloud rally . ""I couldn't get your governor to act. He's supposed to call in the National Guard or the Army and he didn't do it. I couldn't get your governor. So, I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis."" CNN  and  WCCO-TV News , a CBS affiliate in Minnesota, debunked a similar Trump statement in 2020. We found that Walz called in the National Guard hours before Trump contacted him, but Walz has faced criticism about his response’s timing. George Floyd was  murdered by a Minneapolis police officer  on May 25, 2020. Protests — some  peaceful  and some  violent  — erupted soon after video of his death went viral. The Harris-Walz campaign did not respond on the record to our request for information. Walz’s governor’s office also did not respond to PolitiFact’s email asking about Trump’s claim. However, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann  wrote in a statement to CNN in 2020  that Walz ""activated the Minnesota National Guard at the request of the Mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before he talked to the White House."" Tschann told CNN that Walz was in touch with Trump administration officials during the unrest, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley. But Walz was the one who put forward the plans for the use of the guard, he said. WCCO-TV wrote a  timeline of Walz’s 2020 actions .  At 4:04 p.m. CST May 28 in Minnesota, Walz  issued  an  executive order   activating  the Minnesota National Guard  to allow for personnel and equipment to support emergency operations.  Walz wrote that ""feelings of anguish, anger, and disillusionment are justified,"" however, people engaged in ""unlawful and dangerous activity"" including arson, rioting and looting were threatening public safety. Following Walz’s order, Minnesota National Guard Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen said in a  social media post at 4:13 p.m,  ""We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor's request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond."" At 10 p.m., Minneapolis  police abandoned the department’s 3rd Precinct  which was overtaken and burned. At 10:30 p.m., May 28, Trump watched the scene on television and called Walz, offering to send in the military, WCCO-TV wrote.  ""We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities,"" The Minnesota National Guard wrote at 10:41 p.m. May 28 in a  social post.  ""Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls."" Protesters demonstrate May 28, 2020, outside of a burning Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct in Minneapolis. (AP)  On May 29,  Walz told reporters  that he had spoken to Trump the night before. ""At that point in time, it was in the process of where I said that we were going to assume control of this, that it was unnecessary,"" he said. Trump, Walz said, had ""pledged his support in terms of anything we need in terms of supplies to get to us.""  Trump  tweeted  near midnight May 29, 2020, that, ""I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right ....."" In  another post that night, Trump wrote : ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!""  When violence continued May 29 and May 30, 2020, Walz called up more troops and, on May 30, he  activated  the entire  Minnesota National Guard. We don’t know whether Trump’s statements influenced Walz to call in more troops, although  the governor’s office told CNN in 2020  that Trump had nothing to do with his decisions. Generally speaking,  the president cannot order the U.S. military  to perform law-enforcement activities domestically. But there are exceptions, primarily an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, that allows states to request federal military assistance and allows the president, in limited circumstances, to deploy military personnel in the U.S. without a state’s consent. In general, the U.S. military cannot be used on U.S. soil. That’s been the case since the signing of the  Posse Comitatus Act  in 1878. We asked Trump spokespeople for evidence that Walz didn’t call in the National Guard. Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly pointed to criticism of the timing of Walz’s actions.  Minnesota Republicans  criticized the governor’s response.  The  Star Tribune  wrote in August 2020 that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters in an interview that Walz hesitated to send in the National Guard. Frey said he called Walz on the evening of May 27, 2020, asking him to send in the National Guard and Walz said he would consider it. The newspaper obtained texts and emails to verify that narrative. In his comments to the Star Tribune, Frey said that he asked whether his verbal requests constituted a formal request, and said that the governor's staff confirmed that they did. But the Star Tribune wrote that the governor's office disputed Frey’s portrayal of what had unfolded. At 10:55 a.m. May 28, 2020, Frey’s office made a written request for the National Guard, the Star Tribune wrote. Tschann told the Star Tribune that more information was needed to deploy soldiers and that Walz pushed Minneapolis city officials for details and a strategy.  The state Department of Public Safety contracted with Wilder Research, a St. Paul nonprofit, to  review  the state’s response. The 2022 review found that the timeliness of the guard’s activation was an area for improvement. It also called for improved communication and coordination with local jurisdictions regarding requests for the guard. The report criticized state and local offices’ actions and said the state and the city of Minneapolis had communicated poorly. The Republican National Committee also pointed to a  May 30, 2020, article in The Washington Post  that said Walz acknowledged the Trump administration’s offer for active-duty military. The U.S. military on May 29, 2020, had ordered several police units to be ready for potential deployment if Walz wanted federal assistance, according to a  May 30, 2020, CNN report . By then, Walz had called up the Minnesota National Guard. Trump said that during the 2020 Minnesota riots, Walz didn’t call in the National Guard. ""So, I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis."" Minneapolis’ mayor, Frey, said Walz initially hesitated to deploy the National Guard on May 27, the day the Minneapolis first requested assistance. But Walz’s executive order shows he called up the National Guard on May 28, before Trump offered federal assistance. We rate Trump’s statement False. RELATED :  Who is Tim Walz?

politifact,"In negotiating releases of Americans held abroad, “(I) gave the opposing country NOTHING — and never any cash.”","Former President Donald Trump’s administration released prisoners held by the U.S. government in exchange for freeing Americans held abroad.      In 2017, the Trump administration agreed to pay $2 million to North Korea for the release of a U.S. citizen detained there, but a White House official said the money was never paid.","After a historic prisoner swap Aug. 1 among the U.S., Russia and other countries, former President Donald Trump questioned the details and compared it with deals he made during his presidency. ""So when are they going to release the details of the prisoner swap with Russia? How many people do we get versus them? Are we also paying them cash?"" Trump wrote Aug. 1 on  Truth Social . ""I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING — and never any cash. To do so is bad precedent for the future.""  Three American citizens were among the  released : U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who was imprisoned in Russia for almost six years; Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who had been imprisoned in Russia for more than a year; and Alsu Kurmasheva, a Radio Liberty journalist detained in October 2023. In exchange for the prisoners held in Russia, the U.S. and other countries released  eight prisoners , including  Vadim Krasikov , who was serving a lifetime sentence in Germany for murder. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. did not exchange money in the deal. Trump’s administration released prisoners held by the U.S. government in exchange for having other nations free Americans held abroad.  ""There is ALWAYS a quid pro quo in hostage diplomacy, as this issue is known,"" said Anthony Wanis-St. John, an American University associate professor of peace, human rights and cultural relations who specializes in conflict zone negotiations. ""It can be material, it can be a reciprocal release, or a political concession that is kept secret or is symbolic."" Here are some examples of prisoner exchanges and their terms during Trump’s administration. In 2019, the U.S.  secured  the release of Xiyue Wang, a U.S. citizen who had been held prisoner in Iran since 2016. Wang was a Princeton University graduate student conducting doctoral research when he was arrested in Tehran and imprisoned on espionage charges. In exchange for Wang’s freedom, the U.S. agreed to release Masoud Soleimani, an Iranian scientist who was arrested and charged with violating American trade sanctions against Iran. The Justice Department had dropped the charges and Soleimani was expected to be released from prison before the exchange took place, The New York Times  reported . In 2020, the Trump administration negotiated the release of Michael White, a U.S. Navy veteran who was imprisoned in 2018 after traveling to Iran to visit a woman he met online. White was serving a 10-year sentence after Iranian authorities convicted him of insulting Iran’s supreme leader and posting private information online, The Associated Press  reported . As part of this deal, the U.S.  agreed to release  Matteo Taerri, also known as Majid Taheri, an Iranian American doctor who had violated U.S. sanctions on Iran. Taerri pleaded guilty and served several months in jail before he was released on bond. The Justice Department  dropped  its charges against Taerri. On Oct. 14, 2020, the Trump administration secured the release of two Americans whom Houthi rebels in Yemen had held captive: Sandra Loli and Mikael Gidada. The remains of Bilal Fateen, an American who died in captivity, were repatriated. In exchange, more than 200 Houthi militants returned from Oman to Yemen, according to  news   reports . The Trump administration did not link the two returns as an exchange, but The Wall Street Journal  reported  that U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials confirmed it was. ""We extend our sincerest thanks to Sultan Haitham bin Tariq of Oman and King Salman of Saudi Arabia for their efforts to secure the release of our citizens,"" National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said  then . In June 2017, a medical team and a State Department representative returned University of Virginia student  Otto Warmbier  to the U.S., after he had been detained in North Korea for more than 17 months. Warmbier was in a  coma , and a few days later, he  died . On April 25, 2019, The Washington Post  reported  that North Korea billed the U.S. $2 million to cover Warmbier’s hospital care. The U.S. envoy sent to retrieve Warmbier signed an agreement to pay the bill under Trump’s orders, the Post reported. ""We did not pay money for our great Otto. There was no money paid. There was a fake news report that money was paid,"" Trump  said  April 26, 2019. But on April 28, 2019, White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said on  ""Fox News Sunday""  that ""it appears"" North Korea did demand money from the U.S. He said ""that is what I’m told"" when asked whether the U.S. envoy signed a document agreeing to pay the money to get Warmbier back. However, Bolton, who was not working in the Trump administration at the time of Warmbier’s release, said the U.S. ""absolutely"" did not pay North Korea any money for the release. Trump said in hostage releases, ""(I) gave the opposing country NOTHING — and never any cash.""  Multiple times during Trump’s administration, the U.S. government released prisoners it held in exchange for freeing Americans held abroad. In one instance, the U.S. agreed to pay money to North Korea for the release of a U.S. citizen, but a White House official said the money was never sent. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth because he never gave cash in exchange for Americans’ release. However, the statement ignores critical facts about the terms the U.S. agreed to in these exchanges. We rate the statement Mostly False.

He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.”","Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz served in the Nebraska and Minnesota National Guards for 24 years. Walz has said he retired in May 2005 to run for Congress; he submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months beforehand.     After Walz filed candidacy paperwork in February 2005, his battalion received a March 2005 notification for a potential — not definite — deployment within two years, not immediately.     Walz’s battalion was not officially ordered to go to Iraq until July 2005, two months after Walz retired.","Republican vice presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance sought to negatively frame the 24-year military career of newly minted Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, Minnesota’s current governor. ""When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,"" Vance  said  Aug. 7 at the Shelby, Michigan, police department. Vance  served  as a combat correspondent for the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 and deployed to Iraq for six months in 2005 but  did not experience combat . Vance continued, ""When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. … I think it’s shameful."" At a different event, Vance used the phrase "" stolen valor "" to describe his accusations against Walz. On X, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, made a  claim similar to Vance’s,  writing, ""Tim Walz TURNED HIS BACK on the soldiers in his unit because he was TOO afraid to deploy to Iraq!!"" Walz retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005. He had submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months beforehand, Fox News  reported , citing the Minnesota National Guard. In March 2005, Walz’s battalion had been notified about a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s congressional campaign said in a  news release  that month, citing the National Guard Public Affairs Office. The Minnesota National Guard said the battalion then received an official order about mobilizing for deployment to Iraq in July 2005, after Walz retired. Vance’s statement misleads by distorting the timeline. Walz had not been ""asked by his country to go to Iraq,"" as Vance said. He had been given a two-year window for a potential, not definite, deployment. And the official deployment notice came after Walz’s retirement.  Walz has said since before his Army retirement that he left to run for Congress. He filed his candidacy paperwork in February 2005, before the March 2005 notification about the potential deployment. This is not a new line of attack. When Walz ran for a second term as Minnesota governor in 2022, his Republican opponent, who did not serve in the U.S. military,  criticized  Walz for leaving the National Guard before his unit deployed to Iraq. Two retired Minnesota National Guard command sergeant majors also  penned a paid letter  to a Minnesota newspaper in 2018 claiming Walz ""embellished and selectively omitted facts"" about his military service. This letter resurfaced on X after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Walz as her running mate. Other  guard   members  who served with Walz have defended him. Walz’s spokesperson in the Minnesota governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment, and the Harris-Walz campaign declined to comment. When reached by  The New York Times , a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson didn’t provide new details about Walz’s retirement timeline and instead highlighted Walz’s record advocating for veterans and their families. When contacted for comment, Vance’s campaign spokesperson sent links to the 2005 Walz campaign news release about the potential deployment and several news stories that quote former members of Walz’s battalion who were upset with him for not deploying to Iraq. Walz enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard on April 8, 1981, two days after his 17th birthday. In 1996, Walz transferred to the Minnesota National Guard, where he served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery until he retired May 16, 2005, Army Lt. Col. Kristen Augé, Minnesota National Guard’s state public affairs officer, told PolitiFact in a statement. During his service, Walz responded to floods and tornadoes, specialized in heavy artillery and was recognized for his proficiency in sharpshooting and hand grenades, Minnesota Public Radio  reported . On Aug. 3, 2003, Walz and his battalion were deployed to Italy to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. Walz returned to Minnesota in April 2004, Augé said. In May 2005, Walz, then 41, officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard to campaign for Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. He  filed  his statement of candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 10, 2005. Walz was elected to Congress in November 2006. Al Bonnifield, who served with Walz in the Minnesota National Guard, told  Minnesota Public Radio  in 2018 that Walz weighed his retirement from the guard and congressional run ""very heavy."" Bonnifield reiterated this to  The Washington Post  on Aug. 7. ""Would the soldier look down on him because he didn’t go with us? Would the common soldier say, ‘Hey, he didn't go with us, he’s trying to skip out on a deployment?’ And he wasn’t,"" Bonnifield said in 2018. Doug Julin, who served as a more senior command sergeant major in Walz’s battalion, said Walz went over his head to get retirement approval before the unit’s deployment was official, because Julin would have ""analyzed it and challenged him,"" the  New York Post  reported Aug. 8. Others who served in Walz’s battalion have said he ""ditched"" them and his actions were ""dishonorable,"" Fox News  reported . Walz’s unit received an ""alert order"" for mobilization to Iraq on July 14, 2005, Army Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, Minnesota National Guard’s director of operations, told PolitiFact in a statement. The unit received the official Department of the Army mobilization order Aug. 14, 2005, and mobilized Oct. 12, 2005, Rossman said. The unit deployed to Iraq in March 2006 and was deployed for 19 months, according to an October 2007  congressional resolution . The two retired Minnesota National Guard command sergeant majors who wrote the 2018 letter said the battalion received a ""warning order"" in early 2005 ""to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq."" They did not specify the warning letter’s date. Augé of the Minnesota National Guard told PolitiFact the agency doesn’t have information about any unofficial orders that might have been sent to the battalion. An  archived March 20, 2005, press release  from Walz’s congressional campaign website said the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced March 17, 2005, ""a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard."" The announcement said a portion of Walz’s battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years. Walz said in his campaign’s press release, ""As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington, D.C., or in Iraq. I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race."" Although Walz had been  promoted  in 2004 to command sergeant major, he retired in 2005 as a master sergeant,  one rank below  command sergeant major, ""for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,"" Augé said. Joseph Eustice, a 32-year military veteran who served in and led the same guard unit as Walz, told  The New York Times  and  NewsNation  in Aug. 7 interviews that when Walz decided to retire in May 2005, their unit had heard rumors of a potential deployment to Iraq, but had not received official orders. Vance said, ""When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him."" Vance’s statement ignores that Walz’s unit was not officially ordered to go to Iraq until July 2005, two months after Walz officially retired. After 24 years of military service, Walz said he retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005 to run for Congress. He had submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months beforehand. He filed candidacy paperwork in February 2005. There’s an element of truth in Vance’s statement because in March 2005, before Walz officially retired, his battalion was notified of possible deployment to Iraq within two years. Walz was aware at the time of his retirement that deployment could be possible and one of his fellow guard members described Walz’s retirement decision as ""very heavy."" But the March 2005 notification gave a time frame of two years for a possible — not definite — deployment that would not occur immediately, which is the way Vance’s statement framed it. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker, Vance, who did not provide details to support his statement. We rate it Mostly False.

politifact,"""El crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump"".","Si ves algo que te hace preguntar: ¿es cierto?  Mándanoslo por WhatsApp y nuestro equipo lo investigará, (813) 260-7595. ¡Sigue nuestro canal en WhatsApp!","En un momento de su presentación como candidato demócrata a la vicepresidencia, el gobernador de Minnesota, Tim Walz, lanzó una crítica al ex presidente Donald Trump sobre el crimen. ""No se equivoquen"",  dijo Walz  en el mitin del 6 de agosto de 2024 en Filadelfia con la candidata presidencial demócrata, Kamala Harris. ""El crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump. Y eso sin contar los delitos que él cometió"". La última parte de la declaración de Walz se refería a la  condena de Trump  en mayo de 2024 por 34 cargos de falsificación de registros comerciales en un esquema para encubrir un pago de dinero secreto a la actriz porno Stormy Daniels previo a las elecciones presidenciales de 2016. Pero, qué hay de la afirmación de Walz de que ""el crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump"", que Walz repitió en un discurso el 7 de agosto en Eau Claire, Wisconsin. La afirmación del recién nombrado candidato a la vicepresidencia necesita contexto y algunas aclaraciones. La definición de crimen violento del Buró Federal de Investigaciones de Estados Unidos (FBI, por sus siglas en inglés) incluye cuatro tipos de delitos: homicidio, violación, robo y asalto agravado. La tasa de crímenes violentos en Estados Unidos aumentó durante las décadas de 1970 y 1980, alcanzando su pico en 1991 y disminuyendo desde entonces, con algunos repuntes periódicos. Durante los primeros tres años de la presidencia de Trump, la tasa de crímenes violentos por cada 100,000 habitantes — la métrica a la que nos remitió la campaña de Harris-Walz, cuando pidió información — cayó cada año. Pasó de 377.7 crímenes violentos por cada 100,000 habitantes en 2017 a 373.4 en 2018 y a 363.9 en 2019. Sin embargo, en 2020, la tasa de crímenes violentos se disparó a 385.2 por cada 100,000 personas, más alta que cualquier año anterior bajo la presidencia de Trump. El repunte en 2020 fue especialmente pronunciado en el caso de los homicidios. En 2020, el número de homicidios en Estados Unidos reportados al FBI aumentó en 5,795, pasando de 16,619 en 2019 a 22,414 en 2020. En cualquier año anterior desde 1961, el número de homicidios nunca había aumentado en más de 2,000 en un año, lo que significa que el aumento de 2020 fue casi el triple del récord anterior. Sin embargo, incluso considerando el repunte de 2020, la tasa de crímenes violentos en el último año de Trump fue aún más baja que en el último año de su predecesor, el presidente demócrata Barack Obama. En 2016, la tasa de crímenes violentos fue de 389.9 por cada 100,000 habitantes, un poco más alta que la tasa de 2020. Otro contexto importante: el nivel máximo de crímenes violentos en 2020 representaba una tasa mucho más baja que la de hace unas décadas. En 2020, hubo 385.2 crímenes violentos por cada 100,000 habitantes. En contraste, la tasa nunca bajó de 500 entre 1979 y 2001, y alcanzó su punto máximo de 758.2 en 1991. Culpar exclusivamente a Trump por el aumento de homicidios en 2020 ignora lo inusual que fue la vida en Estados Unidos (y el mundo entero) ese año. A partir de marzo de  2020 , el país fue golpeado rápida y severamente por la pandemia de coronavirus. Esto desestabilizó la economía, cambió los hábitos de viaje colectivos, llevó a muchas personas a quedarse en casa y dejó temporalmente a muchos estadounidenses sin empleo ni ingresos. Otro factor inusual ese año fue el asesinato de George Floyd por parte de la policía de Minneapolis. La muerte de Floyd provocó un clamor nacional y una reflexión sobre los problemas raciales. ""Señalaría los cambios en las actitudes hacia la policía y la legitimidad de la policía, así como la retirada policial después de la muerte de Floyd como factores potencialmente primarios detrás del aumento"", Jeff Asher, analista de la empresa de consultoría AH Datalytics, que se especializa en datos sobre criminalidad le dijo a  PolitiFact  en junio. ""Hay evidencia de que el aumento en el porte de armas de fuego en los meses posteriores a la pandemia podría haber actuado como un acelerante, inflando aún más el aumento"", agregó Asher. El CEO del Consejo de Justicia Criminal, Adam Gelb,  ha calificado  el entorno de 2020 como ""una clase magistral en criminología"", dado su inicio repentino, su duración y su impacto dramático en las personas e instituciones. Lo más probable es que todos estos factores se combinaran y se alimentaran entre sí. ""No es posible desentrañar cada factor de la pandemia"", dijo Asher. En 2021, durante el primer año en el cargo del presidente Joe Biden,  la tasa de homicidios  se mantuvo alta; los homicidios aumentaron en 122 ese año en comparación con 2020. Desde entonces, han disminuido, y aunque los datos actuales tienen un retraso de más de un año, las estimaciones indican que la tasa de homicidios está en camino de regresar a su nivel prepandémico. Walz dijo, ""El crimen violento aumentó bajo Donald Trump"". Después de disminuir durante los primeros tres años de la presidencia de Trump, el aumento de la tasa de crímenes violentos en 2020 (su último año del republicano en el cargo) fue lo suficientemente grande como para borrar las disminuciones de los años anteriores de su mandato. Sin embargo, la tasa de crímenes violentos en el último año de Trump fue aún ligeramente más baja que en el último año de su predecesor, Barack Obama. Los expertos nos dijeron que es incorrecto culpar exclusivamente a Trump por el aumento de la criminalidad. El repunte fue causado por una confluencia de la pandemia de coronavirus y el trastorno social tras el asesinato de Floyd por la policía. Calificamos esta declaración como Medio Cierta.

Los aplicantes también deben pasar un examen escrito y otro que muestra su habilidad de conducir.","El congresista republicano de Florida Byron Donalds dijo en una entrevista en Fox News que los demócratas presentan erróneamente al gobernador de Minnesota Tim Walz como un demócrata moderado. Walz, compañero de fórmula de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, ""es un progresista radical"" que quiere ""fronteras abiertas"",  dijo Donalds  el 6 de agosto.  ""Tim Walz firmó una ley para dar licencia de conducir a inmigrantes ilegales en Minnesota, él quería cuidado de salud para los inmigrantes ilegales en Minnesota, ese hombre es increíblemente izquierdista"",  dijo  Donalds. Donalds repitió su afirmación en  X , enumerando las cosas que, según él, representaban al ""verdadero Tim Walz"".  El  congresista republicano de Minnesota Pete Stauber , y publicaciones en  TikTok  y  X  repitieron afirmaciones similares sobre el historial de Walz. El 7 de marzo de 2023, como gobernador de Minnesota, Walz firmó el  H.F. 4 . Este proyecto de ley amplió el acceso a las licencias de conducir a las personas del estado, independientemente de su estatus migratorio. Los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes y del Senado apoyaron ampliamente la medida. Sólo un republicano de la Cámara de Representantes la respaldó.  Esta ley revocó una  orden  de 2003 del exgobernador republicano Tim Pawlenty que  prohibía al estado  proveer licencias a personas en el país ilegalmente. Walz  dijo  en marzo de 2023 que la ley haría las carreteras más seguras y que él era ""partidario de este proyecto de ley desde hace mucho tiempo"". ""Garantizar que los conductores en nuestro estado tengan licencia y lleven seguro hace que las carreteras sean más seguras para todos los minnesotanos"",  dijo  Walz.  PolitiFact contactó a la oficina de Donalds, pero no obtuvo respuesta. La campaña de Harris-Walz no hizo comentarios. La oficina del gobernador de Minnesota tampoco respondió. El  Migration Policy Institute  calcula que unas 81,000 personas viven ilegalmente en Minnesota. La población de Minnesota es de unos 5.7 millones de habitantes. La ley entró en vigor el 1 de octubre de 2023. Esta permite a los inmigrantes que carecen de estatus legal en EE.UU. obtener una licencia de conducir estándar o tarjeta de identificación de Minnesota. Para obtener una licencia de conducir, la gente debe: Presentar dos documentos de identificación , como un pasaporte internacional no caducado o un certificado de nacimiento extranjero, una tarjeta consular o una prueba de residencia actual en Minnesota. Atestiguar que viven en Minnesota. Pagar el costo de la licencia o el carné. Pasar una prueba escrita sobre las normas de circulación y un examen de aptitud para conducir.  Minnesota es el estado que más recientemente ha aprobado este tipo de legislación.  El Distrito de Columbia y otros 18 estados , incluyendo California, Colorado y Nueva York, también tienen leyes para que las personas ilegalmente en EE.UU. obtengan licencia de conducir. Donalds dijo, ""Tim Walz firmó una ley para dar licencia de conducir a inmigrantes ilegales en Minnesota"". Eso es correcto. Walz firmó una ley en 2023 que amplía el acceso a las licencias de conducir sin importar el estatus migratorio del aplicante.  Minnesota es uno de los 19 estados que permiten a las personas que se encuentran ilegalmente en el país solicitar una licencia de conducir.  Calificamos la afirmación de Donalds como Cierta.

The National Archives says 250,000 people attended Martin Luther King's Jr.’s ""I Have a Dream"" speech on Aug. 28, 1963, during the March on Washington.","On Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump told a crowd of supporters to ""fight"" and walk to the U.S. Capitol to pressure leaders not to certify Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. His speech preceded a violent assault on the Capitol. Almost six decades earlier, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his landmark ""I Have a Dream"" speech from the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom that called for racial harmony and civil rights for Black Americans. Now, Trump says the two Washington, D.C., speeches share something else in common: crowd size.  During his  Aug. 8 Mar-a-Lago press conference that touched on myriad topics,  Trump claimed there was a ""peaceful transfer"" of power when he left office in 2021. Biden was sworn in as president under heavy security, but the effort to stop the counting of electoral votes two weeks before was unprecedented and  brutal .  When a reporter challenged Trump’s ""peaceful transfer"" framing, Trump answered that ""nobody was killed on Jan. 6,"" which is  also wrong . Trump then pivoted to his own remarks to supporters  that day on the White House Ellipse, which is on the South Lawn, facing the Washington Monument. ""And, you know, it's very interesting, the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I said ‘peacefully and patriotically,’ which nobody wants to say,"" Trump said. (Trump  also told the crowd  on the Ellipse to ""fight."") Then he said: ""The biggest crowd I've ever spoken to, and you've seen Maggie (Haberman, a New York Times reporter), I was in at the mall. I was at the Washington Monument. I was at the whole thing. I had crowds. I don't know who's ever had a bigger crowd than I have, but I had it many times. The biggest crowd I've ever spoken before was that day, and I'll tell you, it's very hard to find a picture of that crowd. You see the picture of a small number of people, relatively, going to the Capitol, but you never see the picture of the crowd.  ""The biggest crowd I've ever spoken. I've spoken to the biggest crowds, nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything — same number of people, if not, we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people. But when you look at the exact same picture, and everything's the same, because it was the fountains, the whole thing — all the way back from Lincoln to Washington. And you look at it, and you look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd, we actually had more people. They said I had 25,000 and he had a million people, and I'm OK with it because I like Dr. Martin Luther King."" A PolitiFact reader asked us to fact-check Trump’s comparison with King’s ""I Have a Dream"" speech during the 1963 March on Washington. The evidence shows Trump’s Ellipse speech was much smaller than the packed National Mall for  King’s address .  A close listener might pick up that Trump offered imagery about the location that doesn’t line up with Trump’s Jan. 6 ""Save America"" rally, such as that it happened on ""the mall,"" and stretched ""from Lincoln to Washington."" Those details line up with the Trump administration’s July 4, 2019, ""Salute to America,"" which attracted a larger crowd to the mall. Trump may have conflated the events, and the Trump campaign did not respond to our requests to clarify. In recent years, government agencies have not wanted to validate or debunk turnout for political events. (Trump’s first press secretary  made the ridiculously false claim  that Trump’s 2017 inauguration drew the biggest inauguration crowd ever.) So, recent estimates, if they are made at all, tend to come from media outlets, sometimes with the assistance of experts using aerial photography and mathematical formulas. The 1963  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom  was a planned,  peaceful  display of unity among several organizations and grassroots activists that had been fighting for civil rights through boycotts and marches. The event included many celebrities and musicians and multiple speeches in addition to King’s speech. The crowd stretched from the Lincoln Memorial, past the Reflecting Pool and toward the Washington Monument. Here is an  image  of the crowd during King’s speech: A crowd near the Reflecting Pool listens to Martin Luther King Jr. and other speakers during the March on Washington in 1963. (U.S. Information Agency, Press and Publications Service, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) The  National Archives  says 250,000 people attended the March on Washington during King’s speech. The  U.S. Census Bureau  uses a somewhat smaller number of ""more than 200,000."" The  NAACP  said that the rally drew over ""260,000"" people from across the country. Trump had repeatedly encouraged his supporters the month before his  speech at the Ellipse around noon on Jan. 6  to come for a ""big protest"" in Washington.  By the time Trump finished his speech, crowds had started to  gather outside the Capitol. Estimates are fairly loose, but none exceed King’s turnout.  The New York Times  reported  that ""tens of thousands"" of Trump supporters gathered for the rally. The Washington Post  said  ""thousands"" had assembled at the Ellipse for the speech.  The House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack put the crowd number at  53,000 , or at most a quarter of the generally accepted size of the crowd during King’s speech. ""From a tent backstage at the Ellipse, President Trump looked out at the crowd of approximately 53,000 supporters and became enraged,"" the House committee  found . ""Just under half of those gathered — a sizeable stretch of about 25,000 people — refused to walk through the magnetometers and be screened for weapons, leaving the venue looking half-empty to the television audience at home."" The day after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy  told The Associated Press  that law enforcement’s estimates of the overall crowd size in the protests ""were all over the board"" from as low as ""2,000 to as many as 80,000.""  We found  several  photos from that day, including one Reuters  wide-shot image  that features the Washington Monument in the background. With the Washington Monument in the background, people attend a rally in support of former President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021. (AP)   The question that triggered Trump’s crowd-size answer was about Jan. 6, and Trump called it ""the biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to."" But some of the things he said — such as ""the exact same picture"" and ""from Lincoln to Washington"" — correlate with features of a different Trump speech on July 4, 2019. The 2019 ""Salute to America"" event, which draws hundreds of thousands of people each year, honored the military’s branches and featured a military flyover and fireworks. On the Capitol side, many came to hear  singer Carole King  and Trump was the first president in nearly 70 years to add a speech onto the event.  A crowd at the Reflecting Pool listens to a July 4 celebration hosted by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. (Credit: The White House, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) Steve Doig, a professor at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication who has studied crowd size estimates, told PolitiFact that, the photos show the crowd stretching from the Lincoln Memorial to the end of the Reflecting Pool, but give no hint of how far the crowd extends beyond the trees that line the pool.  We were not able to find crowd estimates from the 2019 event. Describing his speech to supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump said he spoke to the ""same number of people, if not, we had more"" than King’s 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The crowd-size comparison is wrong. Credible estimates say many more people attended the 1963 March on Washington during King’s speech than attended Trump’s Ellipse speech.

politifact,Says Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had his stomach pumped “after overingesting horse semen.”,"This story was fabricated, features fake details and has a timeline that doesn’t track with reality.","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz  alluded  to a lewd fake claim about Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance after Vice President Kamala Harris introduced Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate.  Now, Walz is the target of another crass allegation: that nearly 30 years ago his stomach was pumped after ""an unusual overingestion incident."" ""Local man’s stomach pumped after ‘neigh’-borhood dare goes wrong,"" reads what looks like a  headline in a newspaper  called the West Point Daily News.   Local man, in this case, is ""Tim Walz, a local resident of West Point, Nebraska."" The story says he was rushed to West Point General Hospital in August 1995 ""after reportedly overingesting horse semen.""  The purported article quotes ""Dr. Amanda Thompson, the attending physician at West Point General"" and a ""close friend who wished to remain anonymous."" It also features a photo of Walz when he was younger. Facebook  and  Instagram  posts sharing the image of the story were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) This is a fabricated story. Although there is a  West Point News  in West Point, Nebraska, we didn’t find a West Point Daily News.  We also found no West Point General Hospital in West Point, Nebraska, or evidence of a Dr. Amanda Thompson who worked there.  Searching  on Nebraska’s Health and Human Services Department website for Amanda Thompson’s with medical licenses, we found six entries for medication aides, nurse aides, pharmacist interns and pharmacy technicians, but no doctors. The timeline also doesn’t track with reality.  Walz was born in West Point, Nebraska, but moved several times during his childhood, The New York Times reported. He spent some of his childhood in Valentine, Nebraska, and moved to Butte, Nebraska, when he was in high school. After graduating in 1989 from Chadron State College in a Nebraska town with the same name, he spent a year teaching in China before returning to teach high school.  In 1995, when this story says he lived in West Point, he was actually  a resident of Alliance, Nebraska,  more than  300 miles away . In 1996, he moved to Mankato, Minnesota. The photo that appears in the purported stomach-pumping story has been  used in connection  with his time teaching there at Mankato West High School. It appears in an Aug. 6  KSTP-TV news story  about ""a look back on Tim Walz’s early life in Minnesota,"" for example. (The high school didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the photo.) The stomach-pumping story  also shares space  in the image with a story by ""Bob O’Bobston"" about an  ""international moose count underway.""  This story appears to have been  created  with a tool designed to make fake news clippings — the moose article appears in multiple other purported  news clippings .

politifact,"Says Tim Walz said he carried weapons in war, but “he has not spent a day in a combat zone.”","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a 2018 video the Kamala Harris campaign circulated on social media in August, said he wanted to get ""weapons of war that I carried in war"" off the streets.     Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, winning honors for sharpshooting and weapons training, but he has acknowledged he didn’t see combat duty.     A Walz spokesperson said the governor misspoke.","Republicans have been attacking Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military service, something that traditionally registers as a strength for politicians. After Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign  shared  a 2018 video clip of Walz discussing gun control, Republicans pounced on the governor’s statement about weapons that he said he carried in war. In the clip, Walz said, ""We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at."" Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who, like Walz, is a military veteran, took the governor to task for his comment at an Aug. 7 campaign stop in Shelby Township, Michigan. ""He said, and he was making a point about gun control, that ‘we shouldn’t allow weapons that I used in war to be on America’s streets.’ Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?"" Vance said. ""What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone.""  We rated Vance’s comment about Walz abandoning his unit  Mostly False .  The Iraq War was a protracted conflict that spanned 2003 to 2011. During the early years of the war, Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, eyed retirement and a political career. He submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months before retiring in May 2005 to run for Congress.   As he awaited his retirement paperwork’s processing, Walz filed paperwork to run for Congress in February 2005, a month before his battalion received a March notification for a potential deployment to Iraq within two years. Walz’s battalion was officially ordered to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. But was what Vance said about Walz not carrying weapons in combat accurate? Walz first enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard in 1981 days after he turned 17. He transferred to the Minnesota National Guard in 1996, where he served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery until he retired in May 2005. The Associated Press  reported  that Walz was a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard in 1985 when he attended the University of Houston, and that he also served as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard. Walz spent months on active duty deployed overseas, but didn’t serve in Iraq or Afghanistan. He and his battalion deployed to Italy in August 2003 to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. He returned to Minnesota in April 2004, a Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told PolitiFact. In an email, Lauren Hitt, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Walz thanked Vance for his service and ""misspoke"" in the 2018 video. ""In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke,"" Hitt said. ""He did handle weapons of war and believes strongly that only military members trained to carry those deadly weapons should have access to them, unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance who prioritize the gun lobby over our children."" Luke Schroeder, a Trump-Vance campaign spokesperson, said Walz ""absolutely said this, that’s not in dispute,"" pointing to the video the Harris campaign shared on X. Schroeder also pointed to  several   news   articles  about Walz’s military service that showed he didn’t see combat duty. Minnesota Public Radio  reported  in 2018 that in his military career, Walz responded to weather disasters such as floods and tornadoes, and spent months deployed overseas. He specialized in heavy artillery and won ribbons for his proficiency in sharpshooting and hand grenades, the outlet  wrote , citing military records.  He never saw combat, Minnesota Public Radio reported. ""I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,"" Walz told the news outlet. ""I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else."" Vance  served  as a combat correspondent,  working in public affairs  for the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 and deployed to Iraq for six months in 2005. He  did not experience combat , meaning he did not carry weapons on a battlefield. Vance said that Walz said he carried weapons in war, but ""he has not spent a day in a combat zone.""  Although Walz used weapons and trained colleagues to use them during his long military career, his 2018 statement implied that he carried weapons on a battlefield, which he did not.

""He’s sick,"" Fox News host Jesse Watters  said on his Aug. 6 show, hours after Harris’ announcement.  ""Walz forced schools to stock tampons in boys’ bathrooms. Tampons in fourth grade boys’ bathrooms. What a freak. What do boys need tampons for? This guy is not Minnesota nice. He’s Minnesota nuts."" (Internet Archive) The narrative quickly spread across  conservative   social   media . Fox News host  Sean Hannity , Florida Gov.  Ron DeSantis  and Newsmax host  Greg Kelly  made similar claims A Fox News spokesperson pointed PolitiFact to  a law  requiring schools to provide access to free menstrual products for all students in grades 4 through 12.  But the claim about schools being ""forced"" to provide period products in boys’ bathrooms exaggerates the law’s requirements and reveals a lack of understanding of both the law and its practical application. The Minnesota state Legislature passed the provision in  May 2023  as part of a larger education bill that passed  35-32  in the Senate and  70-62  in the House. Walz  signed  it into law May 24, 2023.  Democrats, who had a  majority in both chambers , championed the bill;  one Republican state senator   voted  in its favor.  Students  had  advocated  for the law for years. We contacted Walz and Minnesota’s Department of Education with questions about the law’s goals, interpretation and implementation. We received no response from Walz, and no specific answers from the Education Department, whose spokesperson reiterated the text of the statute.  The law, which took effect Jan. 1,  requires  schools to provide access to menstrual products such as pads, tampons or other similar period products, ""in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12 according to a plan developed by the school district.""  As adopted, the law does not distinguish by sex or gender. It  says  the products ""must be available to all menstruating students.""  This means transgender boys and nonbinary students — who  might   menstruate  and  are permitted to   use  boys’ restrooms — must also have access to the menstrual products.  That does not mean menstrual products must be stocked in boys’ restrooms, legal experts told PolitiFact.  ""As written the law does not require products to be put in men’s restrooms,"" said Lacey Gero, director of government relations at the  Alliance for Period Supplies , a nonprofit organization. ""The law leaves it up to the local school districts to create a plan for providing products in restrooms, but does not specify which restrooms."" Some states with similar laws specify that period products should be provided only in girls’ restrooms, said Suzanne Herman, a lawyer and legal director at  Period Law , a legal group that advocates making menstrual products free. Minnesota does not.  ""It’s more inclusive than other laws, but it certainly doesn’t mandate that they be in all boys’ restrooms,"" Herman said of Minnesota’s law.  For example, the law would allow a school administrator who knows there are trans or nonbinary students who only use the boys’ restrooms to provide menstrual products in those bathrooms, she said. ""But they don’t have to,"" Herman said. ""They could just put (the products) in the unisex ones."" Herman, who has been reviewing states’ laws that require schools to provide menstrual products, said the Minnesota’s law’s wording leads her to believe that, in practice, period products ""are probably in all girls’ bathrooms and unisex ones.""  Republicans tried to  amend  the Minnesota law so it would require providing menstrual products  only in  restrooms  regularly  used by  ""female students"" , but the proposed change  failed  to win enough support. When the law passed in May 2023, Minnesota became the 16th state to require that schools provide free menstrual products, said Sarah Howard, vice president of marketing at  Aunt Flow , a company committed to ensuring access to period products. Herman said that these state laws typically start either in fourth or sixth grade, and the states that provide products to students as early as fourth grade help include students who start menstruating at an early age. Students  advocated for free menstrual products  to help address ""period poverty,"" MPR News, Minnesota’s public radio station, reported. Period poverty refers to  insufficient access  to the menstrual products, education and  sanitation facilities  that would allow people to manage their menstrual health.   Minnesota Gov.

(Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune via AP) It’s unclear exactly how many Minnesota public school students grades 4 to 12 are transgender or nonbinary, but by the best available data, the number is small. A 2022 report by the Williams Institute, a public policy research institute at the UCLA School of Law, found that  about 0.94%  of Minnesota’s 13-17 age group was trans, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2017 to 2020. And nationally, among adults, 2022  survey data  found that from  0.5%  to  1.6%  of U.S. adults are transgender or nonbinary. Meanwhile, 2023 aggregated data from Gallup found  0.9% of U.S. adults  reported that they were transgender.  Some districts, such as Minneapolis Public Schools, require schools to provide improved bathroom access for transgender and nonbinary students, including more accessible all-gender bathrooms, MinnPost, a local news organization,  reported .  The Minnesota Department of Education said it wasn’t tracking school districts’ implementation of the laws, and we were unable to determine how each district has done this.  In an  Aug. 8 editorial , the Star Tribune reported that a spokesperson for Anoka-Hennepin schools, the state’s largest school district, said free menstrual products aren’t found in male-only bathrooms, but they are provided in nongendered bathrooms, girls’ bathrooms or from health staff.   Searching the Nexis news database, we found no reports that menstrual products are being provided currently in boys’ restrooms in any Minnesota school district. Watters said, ""Walz forced schools to stock tampons in boys’ bathrooms."" In 2023, Walz signed a law requiring schools provide access to menstrual products in bathrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12, according to a plan school districts will create.  The law requires ""all menstruating students"" have access to the products. Legal experts said a school would be compliant if it provided period products only in girls’ bathrooms and unisex or all-gender bathrooms, for example.  Although conditions could exist under which a school might be required to stock menstrual products in a restroom traditionally used exclusively by boys, we found no reports that schools  were regularly doing so. Surveys show that transgender and nonbinary people make up less than 2% of adults in the U.S. and an analysis of Minnesota transgender youth ages 13-17 put the figure at less than 1%.  Legal experts said the law, which Watters pointed to as proof of his claim, does not specify that tampons must be provided in boys’ bathrooms. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.  PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

politifact,"JD Vance “literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda.""","In June, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, announced that he had written the foreword for Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts’ forthcoming book, ""Dawn’s Early Light.""     The Heritage Foundation spearheaded Project 2025, a manual containing a wish list of policy proposals in case of a Republican presidential victory in November. Roberts has promoted the work and has often been described as a Project 2025 leader and architect.     In July, former President Donald Trump selected Vance as his vice presidential running mate. The Trump-Vance campaign has sought to distance itself from Project 2025.","In his maiden speech as the Democratic Party’s vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attacked his Republican opponent, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. He argued that Vance’s close ties to Project 2025 are clear. ""JD Vance literally, literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda,"" Walz  said Aug. 6  in Philadelphia, as Vice President Kamala Harris stood behind him. Walz’s description is accurate. Project 2025 , led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, is a  900-page manual  published in 2023 that includes detailed policies that the next Republican presidential administration could apply. The Trump-Vance campaign has sought to  distance itself  from Project 2025, which included a foreword from Heritage Foundation President Kevin D. Roberts titled ""A Promise to America."" Roberts’ forthcoming book, ""Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America,"" includes a foreword by Vance, HarperCollins Publishers’  website  and other  marketing  materials show.  In  leading the Heritage Foundation, Roberts has promoted Project 2025 and has been called on its leaders and architects by numerous news outlets, including  The Associated Press ,  The New York Times ,  The Washington Post ,  Axios  and  PolitiFact . In his opening to Project 2025’s ""Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,"" Roberts said that ""The Heritage Foundation is facilitating this work,"" and called it ""an agenda prepared by and for conservatives who will be ready on Day One of the next Administration to save our country from the brink of disaster."" When the Heritage Foundation  confirmed  that Project 2025 Director  Paul Dans  had  stepped down, Roberts took over as the project’s head . Dans served in Trump’s  administration  in the Office of Personnel Management. Before former President Donald Trump in July selected Vance as his 2024 running mate, Vance touted his involvement in ""Dawn’s Early Light."" ""I was thrilled to write the foreword for this incredible book, which contains a bold new vision for the future of conservatism in America,"" Vance wrote in a  June 19 X post . Broadside Books, a HarperCollins imprint that specializes in conservative literature, is publishing the book. At 304 pages, it ""outlines a peaceful ‘Second American Revolution’ for voters looking to shift the power back into the hands of the people,"" the publisher’s description says.  ""Dawn’s Early Light"" was originally scheduled to be released in  September , but  has been postponed  to the post-Election Day date of  Nov. 12 . Vance’s name is on the book’s cover, according to the publisher’s digital  preview . The book’s marketing strategy has changed in recent weeks, however, following an assassination attempt against Trump, heightened pushback against Project 2025 and Vance’s selection for the Republican ticket.  The New York Times reported July 31 that Broadside Books removed a downloadable advanced copy of the book that had been made available to reviewers and booksellers, removed from the front cover art that showed an image of a burned out match and swapped out its original subtitle, ""Burning Down Washington to Save America,"" for ""Taking Back Washington to Save America."" In an  Aug. 11 interview  with CNN’s Dana Bash, Vance tempered his connection to Project 2025 and called Roberts a friend — a word  Roberts has also used  to describe Vance.  ""Project 2025 is not affiliated with the Trump campaign,"" Vance said. ""Kevin Roberts is a friend of mine, but I wouldn’t say that he speaks for the president in the same way I wouldn’t say that he speaks for me."" The Associated Press on July 30 shared  an excerpt  of an advance copy of Vance’s foreword that read, ""Never before has a figure with Roberts’s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism. The Heritage Foundation isn’t some random outpost on Capitol Hill; it is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump."" The New Republic reported  July 30  that it also obtained a copy of the foreword, which it reprinted on its website. There is no mention of Project 2025 in the excerpt attributed to Vance. It contains the passage shared by the AP and goes on to liken ""modern liberalism"" to ""a well-meaning gardener"" who treats a garden with chemicals, killing both weeds and ""many of the good things."" A modern conservative movement, the excerpt said, needs to recultivate the garden:  ""The old conservative movement argued if you just got government out of the way, natural forces would resolve problems—we are no longer in this situation and must take a different approach. As Kevin Roberts writes, ‘It’s fine to take a laissez-faire approach when you are in the safety of the sunshine. But when the twilight descends and you hear the wolves, you’ve got to circle the wagons and load the muskets.’""  A Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson pointed us to evidence including Vance’s July 19 X post, as well as  book readings  and  speeches  Vance has participated in at the Heritage Foundation. When we asked Vance’s team about Walz’s claim, the campaign responded with an Aug. 9 statement from spokesperson William Martin reiterating that Vance ""has previously said that he has no involvement with (Project 2025) and has plenty of disagreements with what they're calling for."" Walz said Vance ""literally wrote the foreword for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda.""

politifact,"“During Covid, Tim Walz rationed access to monoclonal antibody treatments based on skin color.”","Minnesota’s health department had a centralized program from February 2021 to July 2022 to refer patients for monoclonal antibody treatments based on clinical need.       For about one month of the 16-month program, the increase of risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes for Black, Indigenous and other people of color because of disparate health impacts was considered a health factor in a scoring system used to prioritize treatment referrals.     Race was no longer a scoring factor during a weighted lottery period in early 2022, when monoclonal antibody supplies were lowest and some lower-risk patients were denied referrals.","Shortly after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her presidential running mate, he faced increased scrutiny over how he led his state during the coronavirus pandemic’s apex. One claim is that a Minnesota health department program that sought to ensure equitable distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments discriminated against white people. ""During Covid, Tim Walz rationed access to monoclonal antibody treatments based on skin color. Being non-white gave a person more priority than having hypertension, and was equal in importance to having massive risk factors like diabetes or cardiovascular disease,"" conservative political activist Charlie Kirk wrote  Aug. 6 on Threads . ""How many people did Walz kill because he thought they were less deserving due to their race?"" We contacted a Kirk spokesperson for evidence supporting his claim but received no response. We also found  other  social media  posts  making the same  claim . The notion that access to the treatments was rationed by race and that may have led to the deaths of white people is false and ignores key details about Minnesota’s policy, experts told PolitiFact. The Minnesota Department of Health said the Food and Drug Administration acknowledged that race and ethnicity ""may also place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19."" That risk may not be determined by underlying conditions alone,  possibly because of underdiagnosis of other diseases in Black, Indigenous and people of color populations. To account for that, Minnesota developed a scoring system that factored in race to determine who would be prioritized for the antibody treatments. This system was in effect for about one month of the program’s 16-month duration.  The state had abandoned the scoring system by the time a weighted lottery system was needed when monoclonal antibody treatment supplies were lowest.  A November 2023 case study showed that at least 79% of the people the program referred to get monoclonal antibody treatments were white. White people constitute 77% of the state’s  5.7 million-person population . The Harris-Walz campaign defended Walz’s pandemic actions as governor. ""Americans haven't forgotten that at the height of the pandemic, states were forced to ration treatments for COVID-19 because Donald Trump failed to deliver the resources to keep our families safe and healthy,"" Sarafina Chitika, a campaign spokesperson, said in an email. ""As Governor, Tim Walz made sure treatments for COVID were delivered to patients who needed them most in order to save as many lives as possible despite Trump's failures."" Monoclonal antibody treatments use laboratory-made proteins that mimic a person’s immune system to fight off viruses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  granted emergency use authorization  as early as November 2020 for several of these products to treat COVID-19. These treatments, administered  in outpatient settings, helped reduce the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. Monoclonal antibody treatments were sometimes in short supply during pandemic surges. Minnesota in February 2021 launched the Minnesota Resource Allocation Platform, a program to equitably connect patients with the treatments based on clinical need. The program ran from Feb. 9, 2021, to July 1, 2022. The goal, said J.P. Leider, a University of Minnesota associate public health professor who  helped lead the project , was to have a centralized system to give any Minnesotan access to the treatments based on clinical data, rather than a first-come, first served policy that many states used. The policy involved prioritizing access to the treatments. It first prioritized referrals for the treatment based on FDA criteria for identifying high-risk patients laid out in the agency’s emergency use authorizations, which changed over time. Besides multiple health conditions, the FDA said  in May  and  July 2021  that race or ethnicity may place patients at ""high risk for progression to severe COVID-19"" partly because of other potentially undiagnosed health concerns.   Minnesota later designed a scoring system  first used  in December 2021 that assigned people points, on a scale of zero to 25, based on categories of clinical risk from COVID-19, The program used the Mayo Clinic’s  Monoclonal Antibody Screening Score , but added categories for pregnant women and Black, Indigenous and people of color as risk factors. The state’s Health Department said the score was adapted after studies showed pregnant women and Black people, Indigenous people and people of color ""were independently associated with poor clinical outcomes from COVID-19 infection."" Minnesota’s scoring system awarded: Four points: to pregnant women; patients who are immunocompromised.  Three points: to people with chronic kidney disease; patients 55 years and older with chronic respiratory disease. Two points: to people ages 65 years or older; people with body mass indexes of 35 kg/m2 and higher; people with diabetes; cardiovascular disease in a patient 55 years and older; Black, Indigenous or people of color status. One point: to patients 55 years and older with hypertension, which is also known as high blood pressure. Race alone wouldn’t put people in the highest priority group unless they were older or had other risk factors. Some critics and legal scholars questioned Minnesota’s approach at the time.  Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who criticized Minnesota’s policy  in a 2022 essay , told PolitiFact that considering race in rationing medical care ""would generally be unconstitutional."" ""I set aside unusual situations where race is directly medically relevant — for instance, if some medicine works well for East Asians but not for whites, or some such. That, as I understand it, was not at all relevant to COVID treatments."" Minnesota on Jan. 12, 2022,  removed race as a scoring factor  for the rest of the program amid complaints about discrimination and  threats  of a  lawsuit  by America First Legal, a group started by Stephen Miller, once an adviser to former President Donald Trump. Objections to using race as a factor in treatment allocation were also raised in  Utah  and  New York . Scores for other health risks remained unchanged in Minnesota’s program, although pregnancy was also removed as a factor because pregnant people ""are clinically prioritized, independent"" of their score, the health department said. The state, in its announcement, did not explain why Black, Indigenous or people of color status was removed as a scoring factor.  Andrea Ahneman, a Minnesota Department of Health spokesperson, in a written statement said the department issues health guidance ""based on the best available information at the time, and updates guidance as new information emerges."" ""The Emergency Use Authorizations for the monoclonals noted factors including age, medical conditions, and race and ethnicity could put individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Based on this information and other clinical analysis that showed increased risk for severe illness for people of color, there was a short period of time where a Minnesota guidance document noted race among the considerations for getting a referral for monoclonal antibodies,"" Ahneman said. ""That guidance had changed by the time Minnesota was short of monoclonal supply and running a lottery."" Dan Wikler, a Harvard University ethics and population health professor, said pandemic-era points systems for weighing allocation of life-saving resources, such as vaccines and therapeutics, arose after debate among health professionals and usually came from institutions such as universities or the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Other institutions then adapted these systems, he said; this is what happened in Minnesota. The state’s scoring system was adapted from the Mayo Clinic’s system.  It’s ""ludicrous"" to attribute those health plans to Walz or any other governor, Wikler said. ""Very few would have had any idea of what was going on in these debates, and surely would have been unable to tell you what the guidelines for these institutions were,"" he said. Wikler said the debates centered on balancing twin goals — using resources to do the most good and ensuring that everyone had a fair chance to benefit. ""There is no way to honor both of these goals fully. Among those contributing to the discussion of the ethics of these choices, people of good will often reached very different conclusions,"" Wikler said.  Minnesota’s health department  cited  the FDA’s guidance in 2021  emergency-use   approvals  for monoclonal antibody treatments that ""in addition to certain underlying health conditions, race and ethnicity ""may also place individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19."" That ""acknowledgment means that race and ethnicity alone, apart from other underlying health conditions, may be considered in determining eligibility for (monoclonal antibodies),"" the health department said in its ""ethical framework"" about allocation of the treatments. ""That was based on scientific evidence at the population health level that was showing us every single day that Black people and Latino people were experiencing worse symptoms and were more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to die from the COVID-19 virus,"" University of Minnesota health and racial equity professor Rachel Hardeman said. Provisional age-adjusted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  data shows  that Black people; Hispanics; American Indian or Alaska Natives; and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders all had higher COVID-19 death rates than whites. American Indians and Alaska Natives were about twice as likely to die from COVID-19, and Hispanic, Black, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders were about 1.5 times as likely to die. Hardeman said those disparities were worse during the pandemic’s height.  ""In Minnesota, for instance, in January of 2022 we saw that Black people, while just comprising about 6% of the population in Minnesota, were actually 11% of the COVID-19 hospitalizations for quite some time,"" Hardeman said. ""Certainly those numbers fluctuated, but there was always consistently a gap based on race, which is why this decision was made."" Kirk’s claim that Minnesota rationed health care by skin color has elements of truth in that a scoring system awarded patients who were Black, Indigenous or people of color 2 points, the same as patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease and more than a patient with hypertension. But it ignores several facts and implies, with no evidence, that the scoring system led to deaths of white people. ""I don't have data that shows that (the program led to white people dying). I don't have reason to think that,"" Leider, the public health professor, said. ""What I'll say about the state of Minnesota is that we set up a system where anybody could come in and get a referral. Didn't matter if they had a doctor who knew about this or not, and because of the demographics of our state that we are, especially in the older group, whiter, I think that our system demonstrably prevented hospitalizations and hopefully saved lives, compared to a lot of the other states that were just letting it be first come first serve."" Leider pointed to a 2022  study  of Medicare patients that showed nationwide, people with no chronic diseases were five times likelier to receive monoclonal antibody treatments than people with six or more chronic conditions. A 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  report  also showed much lower use of the treatments among Black, Asian, Hispanic and other races compared with white patients. Dr. Monica Peek, a University of Chicago professor for health justice of medicine, said some public health officials used race as a proxy for exposure to racism, which she said limits access to goods and services and increases exposure to risks and harms. Racialized minorities, she said, have increased risk for chronic diseases and were at an increased risk for COVID-19 exposure. Many front-line workers who had increased risk of contracting COVID-19, such as hospital and grocery store workers, were Black and brown, she said.  The attempts to ""try to mitigate the exposure to racism when we're trying to allocate resources is really an attempt to mitigate the harm that racial and ethnic minorities have been exposed to,"" Peek said. ""And so it's not trying to increase the harm for white people. It's trying to decrease the harm for Black and brown people."" States and cities used different strategies to equitably allocate resources fairly and ensure populations most at risk received resources first, using factors such as chronic diseases or age.  Minnesota’s weighted scoring system with race as a factor was in place from early December 2021 to early January 2022. It was used for less than a month of the 16 months the program operated.  We ""did not use race/ethnicity during (the) lottery, when stuff was at its shortest,"" Leider said. It ""was used for a small time before that, based on clinical guidance, that showed being BIPOC was associated with worse outcomes even after controlling for comorbidities, age, what have you. But that went away before (the) lottery was needed."" A  case study  Leider and other researchers published shows that 31,559 people received referrals through the program to get monoclonal antibody treatments to treat COVID-19 or for protection postexposure. Of the 29,281 people who received it for treatment of the virus, at least  79% were white . About 11% declined to provide a race or ethnicity, and about 9% were people of color, including Black, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic/Latino or other, the data shows. Kirk claimed that in Minnesota, Walz rationed access to monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19 based on skin color, and that white people died because they were denied access. For about a month during the pandemic, Minnesota did factor race into a scoring system to prioritize referrals for the treatments. A case study after the state’s program ended shows that at least 79% of patients who received referrals were white,  in line with the racial composition of the state’s population. People who were clinically eligible for the treatments weren’t denied access, but received referrals after higher-risk patients received theirs. By early 2022, when monoclonal antibody supplies were lowest and Minnesota used a weighted lottery system, race had been removed as a scoring factor. We rate the claim Mostly False.

politifact,"Videos of media talking about Tim Walz as a ""happy warrior"" are proof of government propaganda legalized by Barack Obama.","Vice President Kamala Harris and her presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have sought to portray themselves as ""joyful warriors.""      News reports and cable news pundits have reported on this approach, and many referred to Walz as a ""happy warrior,"" a common political nickname that dates back at least 100 years. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was first elected president in 1932, used it in a speech about New York Gov. Al Smith at the 1924 Democratic National Convention.     The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, signed into law by President Barack Obama, did not legalize propaganda in the U.S. The law, which has no effect on privately owned news outlets, eased U.S. broadcast restrictions on government-funded media, such as Voice of America.","On the presidential campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have sought to cultivate an image of a positive, joyful message to contrast what they say is Republican nominee Donald Trump’s negative campaign. Walz says, ""We are joyful warriors,"" Harris recounted Aug. 7 at an Eau Claire, Wisconsin rally, their second joint appearance. It’s been a common theme in their subsequent appearances together. Many news outlets and opinion pieces have  reported  on the Harris-Walz strategy, with some  referring  to Walz as a "" happy warrior, "" chosen by Harris because of his  upbeat personality . An Aug. 13  Instagram post  saw a more sinister motive in the media reporting, and blamed a former Democratic president. The Instagram post shared a video that showed multiple cable news clips with journalists or pundits referring to Walz as a ""happy warrior."" The Instagram video’s caption called it  ""extreme propaganda,"" and said it was rooted in a Barack Obama-era law. ""It used to be illegal to use media outlets to push propaganda on the American people, it was still covertly done but not as bad as this,"" the caption said. ""Obama legalized government propaganda during his time as president. … Obama’s change to the law is why we are seeing so many news clips all repeating the same Democrat talking points."" But the statement mischaracterizes a law passed during Obama's administration that was related to government-produced media content, not privately owned media such as the cable news outlets seen in the Instagram video. The term can be traced to "" The Character of the Happy Warrior ,"" a 1807 William Wordsworth poem that  described  someone being brave, generous, having strong morals and other positive traits that ""every man in arms should wish to be."" The term emerged in politics by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1924, when Roosevelt  used it  in a speech to describe New York Gov. Alfred Smith while  unsuccessfully  nominating Smith to be the Democrats’ presidential nominee at the party’s national convention in New York. One Roosevelt scholar said a Smith adviser had added the term to Roosevelt’s speech,  The Federalist wrote . The nickname has been applied to multiple politicians since, including former Republican President  Ronald Reagan  and former Democratic Vice President and Minnesota Sen.  Hubert Humphrey . Harris and Walz have embraced this image. ""Thank you for bringing back the joy,"" Walz  told Harris  after she introduced him as her running mate Aug. 6 in Philadelphia. The next day at a campaign stop in Eau Claire, Wisconsin,  Harris said , ""And understand, in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors.""  She  again used the term  ""joyful warriors"" the same day at a Detroit rally. Walz accused Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, of trying to ""steal the joy"" from the country. ""Our next president brings the joy. She emanates the joy,"" Walz said. Both Harris and Walz referred to campaigning  with ""joy""  at an Aug. 9 Glendale, Arizona, rally. At an Aug. 10 Las Vegas rally, Walz again said Harris ""brought out the joy in our politics"" and said their work is tough, "" but we can be happy doing it ."" Despite the Instagram video’s attempt to link the network reporting on this to Obama, it has no connection to the former president. (Although Obama  did use the term  ""happy warrior"" to describe then-Vice President Joe Biden in 2012.) The Instagram post’s narrator referred to a law change during Obama’s administration that she said ""legalized government propaganda"" and led to the news outlets ""repeating the same Democratic talking points."" The post didn’t specify the law but it’s likely referring to Obama’s signing in 2012 of the  Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 , which  PolitiFact found  was the subject of misinformation in 2019.  False social media posts in recent years have said the law legalized government propaganda in the U.S. The law has no effect on independent, privately owned media outlets, such as CNN, NBC and MSNBC, which were shown in the Instagram video.  The bill Obama signed removed some restrictions on U.S.-funded and generated news produced for overseas audiences from being broadcast to U.S. audiences, such as programming produced by the  U.S. Agency for Global Media , which ""broadcasts news and information about the United States and the world to audiences abroad."" Among those programs run by the agency are  Voice of America , an international broadcaster that reaches an audience of more than 350 million people worldwide. Other agency programs include  Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty ,  Radio Free Asia  and  Middle East Broadcasting Networks .  Before the law was passed, those outlets’ programming could be viewed or listened to in broadcast quality only in foreign countries. Much of that programming was already available in the U.S. online. The change in the law allows content produced by the government to be made available in broadcast quality in the U.S. upon request. An Instagram post said videos of media talking about Walz as a ""happy warrior"" are proof of government propaganda legalized by Barack Obama. The Harris-Walz ticket has sought to portray itself as ""joyful warriors."" Many news outlets reported on this strategy and used the term ""happy warrior"" to describe Walz. It’s a common political nickname that has been given to U.S. politicians since at least 1924. An Obama-era law eased U.S. broadcast restrictions for government-funded news, such as what’s produced by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The law does not apply to privately owned media companies such as those featured in the Instagram video.

politifact,Kamala Harris voted in favor of passing a law in 2022 to tax tips.,Tips were federally taxed before Vice President Kamala Harris voted in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.      The IRS’ tip reporting program is unrelated to the Inflation Reduction Act. It was introduced in 2023 as a way for employers in the service industry to voluntarily report tips. Similar tip compliance programs have existed since 1993.,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both said they would stop taxing tips in their bid for the presidency. But some people online have called Harris hypocritical, accusing her of voting in 2022 to tax service workers’ tips.  An  Instagram post  shows a video of Harris voting for the Inflation Reduction Act. Text overlaying the video reads, ""Kamala Harris Hopes Service Workers Forget She was the Tie-Breaking Vote for the IRS to GO AFTER TIPS!""  The video then claims that the Inflation Reduction Act hired 87,000 IRS agents to launch a tip reporting site. ""KAMALA TAXED YOUR TIPS,"" another text layer says. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) People have had to pay federal taxes on tips for decades, long before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed. In 2021, the IRS said it planned to hire more than 86,000 new employees over 10 years. But those employees would not all be working in enforcement. And the IRS tip reporting program is a voluntary program that would replace existing tax compliance programs.  The 2022  Inflation Reduction Act  increased taxes on large corporations, including companies making more than $1 billion in three years. It also gave an additional $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The claim that the IRS would hire 87,000 IRS agents came from a 2021 Department of Treasury  report  that said the IRS would use the $80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire 86,852 full-time employees.  PolitiFact  previously   found  that the new hires would not work solely as auditors or in enforcement. Some of the additional funding would also go toward operations support, taxpayer services and modernizing the agency’s business system, a  congressional research report  showed. The IRS did propose a  tip reporting program  in 2023 that would let service industry employers report tips voluntarily to help with tax compliance. The program is not entirely new. It would replace three other tip compliance agreements that have existed since  1993 .  Kamala Harris did not vote for a law that taxed service workers’ tips. Tips have been federally taxed for decades.  In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act allocated $80 billion to hire 87,000 full-time IRS employees. Those employees would be hired in a 10-year period, meaning the 87,000 new employees could not all be hired to launch the agency’s tip reporting program.  The IRS did start a program in 2023 in which employers could voluntarily report tips to the IRS. That program is not a new concept and was intended to replace three similar tip compliance programs.

politifact,Gov. Tim Walz delivered paid family leave in Minnesota but “Republicans are blocking” a Biden-Harris proposal.,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill in 2023 that provides paid family leave starting in January 2026.     Democrats in Congress have proposed the Family Act since 2013, but this paid family leave plan has not progressed.     President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better proposal initially included four weeks of paid family leave, but Sen. Joe Manchin, then a Democrat, objected to the bill. Without Republican support, that doomed the bill. The legislation that became the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act did not include family leave.","Transportation Department Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a frequent cable news surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, praised the track record of her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. On CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" Buttigieg rebutted rhetoric from Republican presidential nominee and Ohio Sen. JD Vance about  Democrats being ""antifamily.""   ""So, if you want to talk about promoting children, promoting family, put your money where your mouth is,"" Buttigieg said Aug. 11. ""Same with a lot of other policies, like, I don't know, paid family leave, something that Tim Walz delivered in Minnesota, something that the Biden-Harris administration sought to deliver for the American people. Right now, Republicans are blocking it, but that's something that they could certainly change their tune on, but they haven't."" Buttigieg was responding to Vance’s comment earlier in the show that ""our country has become antifamily in its public policy."" Vance has gotten  backlash  over two interviews he gave in 2021, one in which he said the U.S was being run by "" a bunch of childless cat ladies ."" We decided to examine Buttigieg’s claim about Walz signing paid family leave in Minnesota and whether ""Republicans are blocking"" it on the federal level. We found that Walz signed paid family leave into law in 2023. The state program won’t take effect until 2026. As for Buttigieg blaming Republicans for the lack of a federal family leave policy, the Biden White House pointed to the stalled  Build Back Better legislation  and the  Family Act , a longtime Democratic bill. The White House also highlighted Republican opposition to a family leave proposal in Michigan, where a Michigan House GOP memo  described  a Democratic proposal as ""a new tax to pay for summer break for adults."" In 2022, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party in Minnesota flipped the Senate and maintained control of the House, and Walz won a second term as governor. That trifecta allowed the party to pass paid medical and family leave after a  yearslong push . Walz  signed a bill in May 2023  to provide up to 12 weeks of paid medical leave for employees and up to 12 weeks of family leave, which includes bonding with a child, caring for a family member, supporting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and supporting for active-duty deployments domestically or abroad. There is a maximum of 20 weeks available in a benefit year if someone takes both medical and family leave. The state will pay leave benefits in the program, which applies to small and large businesses and  takes effect in January 2026 . Recipients will be  paid based on a formula . The maximum weekly benefit payment for eligible workers is equal to the state average weekly wage ($1,337 in 2023).  ""By signing paid family and medical leave into law, we’re ensuring Minnesotans no longer have to make the choice between a paycheck and taking time off to care for a new baby or a sick family member,"" Walz  said  in May 2023. The state used a projected budget surplus to jump-start the program; funding will then shift to a payroll tax split between employers and workers.  According to the  Bipartisan Policy Center , 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted mandatory paid family leave systems.  The  U.S. is an outlier  on paid maternity and parental leave.  Polls  show  widespread support , including by Republicans, but Congress has not passed legislation. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for parents of newborn or newly adopted children if the parents work for a company with 50 or more employees. In 2020, the policy was extended to caregivers of sick family members. The law applies only to unpaid leave.  Every Congress since 2013 has filed the Family Act to create paid leave for workers. The current version, introduced by  Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. , with a counterpart in the  House , has only Democratic co-sponsors and has not received a vote. That legislation is modeled on what has worked in the states’ legislation, said Vicki Shabo, an expert on paid family leave at New America, a left-leaning think tank. Jane Waldfogel, a paid leave expert and a Columbia University School of Social Work professor, told PolitiFact that Republicans are more supportive of paid leave than they’ve been in the past, but that there are disagreements about who should be covered and how the leave would be funded. ""Democrats favor a comprehensive bill that would cover paid family and medical leave for new parents and those needing leave for their own serious illness or to care for a seriously ill family member, while Republicans have focused on leave for new parents only,"" Waldfogel said. ""And Democrats favor a social insurance model, while Republicans instead have proposed that workers would draw funds from their future (Social Security) or child tax credits."" Some Republicans have taken steps toward expanding paid parental leave, but those efforts have fallen short for most workers. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump backed six weeks of paid maternity leave. In 2020, he supported an idea by his daughter and adviser Ivanka to provide paid maternity leave. He  didn’t keep the campaign promise  for all workers, but he did sign a law offering most federal employees 12 weeks of paid leave for the arrival of a child. (That left out the other 150 million-plus workers outside the federal government.) In 2018,  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla , introduced a bill to let new parents borrow from their future Social Security benefits to pay for their child-related leave. Supporters liked it because it created no new taxes, but critics said it would hurt low-income workers. It drew zero co-sponsors. Biden promised  in the 2020 campaign that he would create a national paid family and medical leave program that would allow all employees to take up to 12 weeks of paid time off. The promise is  Stalled  on our  Biden Promise Tracker . After originally being negotiated out of Biden's sweeping  Build Back Better spending bill framework , the family leave provision returned in a more limited form. The spending bill that  passed the House  in November 2021 included four weeks of paid annual family and medical leave. It had no Republican support. The package had provisions about  clean energy, child tax credits and health care  and included additional taxes on wealthy Americans. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., spoke for more than eight hours about his objections,  predicting  it would be bad for the economy. But in the Senate, Joe Manchin, then D-W.Va.,  objected  to the bill’s social policy spending on child tax credits and paid leave; this and Republican opposition doomed the bill’s chances in the Senate. (Manchin later became an independent.)  Republicans opposed the legislation, saying it was too expensive.  ""The best Christmas gift Washington could give working families would be putting this bad bill on ice,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,  said  about a week before Christmas in 2021. The bill that earned Manchin’s support and passed the Senate in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act, was limited mostly to policies on climate change, health care and corporate taxation, and omitted family and medical leave. Since then, a bipartisan House  working group  has released a policy framework for paid leave but has yet not released a new bill.  Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a leader of a  bicameral working group , said in a July 30  virtual discussion  about paid leave, ""The key thing is how do you pay for it, that’s the rub."" Buttitieg said Walz delivered paid family leave in Minnesota but ""Republicans are blocking"" a Biden-Harris proposal. Walz signed a bill in May 2023 to provide for paid family leave. It takes effect in 2026. Republicans, citing spending concerns, have broadly resisted federal paid family leave similar to the kind Walz signed into law. Trump failed to expand paid leave to all workers when he was president. In 2021, Biden’s Build Back Better proposal, which included four weeks of paid family leave annually along with many other programs, failed to garner enough support when all Republicans and then-Democratic Sen. Manchin opposed it.  A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers have taken steps to research paid family leave, but it hasn’t led to a bill. Democrats have proposed paid family leave bills akin to what Walz signed for a decade. The statement is accurate about Walz’s record but needs clarification about why family leave has not passed at the federal level. We rate this statement Mostly True.

politifact,Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill “redefining ‘sexual orientation’ to include pedophiles.”,"The bill, called the ""Take Pride Act,"" updated the definition of ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"" in the Minnesota Human Rights Act. It didn’t include pedophiles in these definitions, nor did it give pedophiles legal protections.     Legal experts told PolitiFact that laws prohibiting discrimination because of sexual orientation do not protect pedophiles, even if they do not include that specific disclaimer.     In Minnesota, an adult who engages in sexual conduct with a minor can be charged with a first-degree felony, which is punishable by up to 30 years of imprisonment, a fine of up to $40,000 or both.","Republicans claim Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz approved legal protections for pedophiles as Minnesota governor. RNC Research, an X account run by former President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee,  posted  Aug. 6 that Walz signed a bill into law ""removing ‘physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult’ from (Minnesota’s) human rights law — redefining ‘sexual orientation’ to include pedophiles."" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.,  reshared  this X post and wrote, ""Anyone who extends equal rights protections to pedophiles has no business anywhere near the White House."" Conservative commentator and podcast host Isabel Brown made a similar claim on Instagram. The caption of her Aug. 7  post  read, ""Last February, the state of Minnesota (& Governor Walz) updated the law’s definition of s*xual orientation to SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE adults who are attracted to children in a physical or s*xual manner."" And an Aug. 9  Threads post  claimed Walz signed a bill that ""made pedophiles a protected class in Minnesota."" (Screengrabs from X and Instagram) The Instagram and Threads posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) These claims mislead about the measure, called the ""Take Pride Act,"" which did not add protections for pedophiles. It clarified definitions for sexual orientation and gender identity in the state’s human rights law. It doesn’t include pedophiles in these definitions, nor does it give pedophiles legal protections. Democratic state Rep. Leigh Finke, Minnesota’s first transgender legislator, introduced the bill,  House File 1655 , in February 2023. It passed the Legislature as part of a larger  public safety bill , and Walz signed it into law in May 2023. The Take Pride Act amended the existing definition of ""sexual orientation"" in the  Human Rights Act  and created a new definition for ""gender identity."" Both were already protected classes under Minnesota law. The  Minnesota Human Rights Act  prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, public services, education, credit and business based on race, religion, disability, national origin, sex, marital status, familial status, age, sexual orientation and gender identity. During a March 2023  state House panel discussion  of the bill, Finke said it ""modernizes"" the Human Rights Act, ""bringing a more contemporary understanding"" of sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill amended the definition of ""sexual orientation"" to remove a line that said: ""‘Sexual orientation’ does not include a physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult."" Critics have pointed to that change as proof the measure added protections for pedophiles. But lawmakers who supported the bill said the updated language aimed to sever any perceived ties between pedophilia and a person’s sexual orientation. In May 2023, before the bill passed, PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim that the bill would make it ""illegal to discriminate against child rapists."" We rated this  False . Legal experts we interviewed in May 2023 said laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation do not protect pedophiles, even if they do not include that specific disclaimer. Minnesota statutes already specify that sexual orientation is about having attachments to another person regardless of that person’s sex, not that person’s age, Brian Soucek, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, told PolitiFact in May 2023. ""No court in the country has or would ever say that a law protecting people from discrimination based on their sexual orientation extends to protecting pedophilia,"" Soucek said. Democratic state Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn  said  during an April 26, 2023, legislative session that the provision amending the ""sexual orientation"" definition had ""gone off the rails a bit on social media."" ""Nothing in the bill changes or weakens any of the crimes against children in our criminal statute, or the state’s ability to prosecute those who break the law. Of course pedophilia is not a protected class, is not a sexual orientation, which is why the language never should have been in the bill in the first place,"" Becker-Finn said. Before the bill passed, Republican state Rep. Harry Niska  added language  to the bill that said: ""The physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult is not a protected class under this chapter."" But lawmakers later removed this language, and it was not included in the final text of the bill that Walz signed, the  Minnesota Star Tribune  reported. In Minnesota, penetration with a person younger than 18 or sexual contact with a person younger than 14 is subject to a charge of  first-degree criminal sexual conduct , punishable by up to 30 years of imprisonment, a fine of up to $40,000, or both.

politifact,California law lets you “rob a store as long as it’s not more than $950” and “not get charged.” Kamala Harris “did that.”,"Kamala Harris was California’s attorney general in 2014 when voters approved Proposition 47, a ballot initiative aimed at reducing the state’s overcrowded prison population.     The bill said people convicted of shoplifting items valued at $950 or less can be charged only with a misdemeanor, not a felony.      The $950 threshold already existed, having been signed into law by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2010. Proposition 47 affirmed it and addressed more theft categories.     Harris had no role in creating the ballot initiative and remained publicly neutral about it, experts said.","At a  news conference  at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, former President Donald Trump blamed  Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for a 2014 California law he falsely said allowed shoplifters to steal from retailers without consequence. ""You're allowed to rob a store as long as it's not more than $950. Has everyone ever heard of that?"" Trump said Aug. 15. ""You can rob a store, and you have these thieves going into stores with calculators, calculating how much it is, because if it's less than $950 they can rob it and not get charged. That was her that did that."" Trump was referring to Proposition 47, a 2014 California voter-approved law, ""which makes the theft of stolen property worth less than $950 a misdemeanor charge rather than a felony,"" Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson said, linking to a June 12 San Francisco Chronicle  article  about the law and a new ballot initiative that could roll back some of its provisions. That article mentions neither that Harris was involved in creating the law, nor that thefts of less than $950 bring no charges. The article also noted that other states, including Republican-led  Texas at $2,500 , have higher financial thresholds to meet felony charges for theft. California’s law did reduce some nonviolent crimes from felonies to misdemeanors and did include a $950 felony threshold on retail thefts.  But Trump’s comments mislead about the law and Harris’ role in its creation. Proposition 47 was a ballot initiative created in response to a  court ruling that ordered  California to reduce its prison population because of overcrowding. Then-San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón and former San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne co-authored the bill, with collaboration from nonprofits such as Stanford’s Justice Advocacy Project and Californians for Safety and Justice, said UC Law San Francisco professor Hadar Aviram. Proposition 47 downgraded some nonviolent drug and property crimes to misdemeanors. A  summary  Harris’ office prepared in 2014, said the law ""requires misdemeanor sentence instead of felony for the following crimes when amount involved is $950 or less: petty theft, receiving stolen property, and forging/writing bad checks."" Under state law before Proposition 47, shoplifting property worth $950 or less was often a misdemeanor, but such crimes could, in some cases, also be charged as a burglary, which could be a felony, Harris’ summary said. Proposition 47 said shoplifting property under that threshold would always be considered a misdemeanor. The proposition defined ""shoplifting,"" a misdemeanor, in the  state’s penal code  as ""entering a commercial establishment with the intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours"" and the value of property taken is $950 or less. Entering a retail store with the intent to steal when a store is not open is burglary, which could be a felony. The $950 threshold in Proposition 47, however, was not new to state law. The California Legislature in 2010  passed Assembly Bill 2372 , which set a $950 threshold between petty theft (a misdemeanor) and grand larceny (a felony), raising it to account for inflation from $400, a threshold set in 1982. Then-Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed that change into law.  Proposition 47 essentially affirmed that threshold and addressed a few more theft categories, such as auto thefts and thefts of some agricultural products, that the 2010 legislation didn’t address, experts told PolitiFact. Proposition 47 passed with  59% of voters  supporting the ballot measure. Harris, in the same election, was reelected as attorney general.  The law has been controversial, with critics  blaming  it for increasing  retail  crime. Voters in November will consider  Proposition 36 , which would mandate drug treatment and allow for felony sentences for certain drug and theft crimes. It would leave the $950 threshold intact, but allow felony charges for people with two or more previous theft convictions. California’s $950 threshold for a theft felony is lower than in 39 states, plus the District of Columbia, a list provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows.  No, theft of any amount is still a crime in California, Aviram said. ""Theft of less than $950 is a misdemeanor, theft of $950 or more is grand theft, which is a felony,"" Aviram said. ""Both are criminal offenses, and both are prosecutable and punishable."" People convicted of misdemeanor shoplifting still  face penalties  of up to six months in jail and/or fines of up to $1,000. People with prior theft convictions or registered sex offenders could face  more severe penalties  under the state’s penal code. Will Matthews, a spokesperson for  Californians for Safety and Justice , an advocacy group that co-authored Proposition 47, called Trump’s comments about the law ""patently absurd."" ""Crime is still crime in California,"" Matthews said. ""Misdemeanors in California are still punishable"" with jail time.  Matthews said the underlying idea of Proposition 47 was to make people committing low-level crimes eligible for local jail sentences instead of state prison, which would save taxpayers money. Harris wasn’t involved in creating or passing Proposition 47. As attorney general, she wrote only the proposal’s title and language about it on the state ballot. Harris’ campaign did not return a request for comment, but Matthews said she was not involved in the law’s creation, and multiple news outlets have  reported  that Harris  remained  publicly  neutral  on the bill. ""She played really no role in Proposition 47 at all,"" Matthews said. ""She was the attorney general of the state of California at the time that Proposition 47 was on the ballot, and as the attorney general, when it comes to ballot initiatives like that, her responsibility is to be neutral."" Harris, as part of her duties, was responsible for verifying  that the proposal met the number of signatures required to be added to the state ballot. But ""she didn’t endorse or oppose Proposition 47 when it was on the ballot,"" Matthews said. Stanford University Law Professor Robert Weisberg, co-director of its Criminal Justice Center, said Harris was ""resolutely neutral"" on Proposition 47, as ""she was on almost all major reform initiatives"" while she was attorney general.

That is typically how ballot initiatives in California work, Aviram said. ""Voter initiatives in California are authored by lobbying groups and nonprofits. They are submitted to the Attorney General's office for  official title and summary , but the responsibility for their crafting ultimately lies with whoever proposes them and collects enough signatures to put them on the ballot,"" Aviram said in an email. Some Republicans opposed to the law  criticized  Harris, saying she misrepresented the bill  in a summary  her office wrote.  One California assemblymember  said she misled voters  by titling the bill the ""Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,"" but that was the title the bill’s authors had proposed. Harris had titled it, ""Criminal Sentences. Misdemeanor Penalties. Initiative Statute,"" which was the version printed on the ballot.  Trump said Harris was responsible for a California law that lets people steal with no penalties as long as the goods are valued at $950 or less. He’s wrong on two counts. There is a $950 threshold cited in Proposition 47 between a misdemeanor or felony theft charge in the state. A 2010 law a Republican governor signed set that threshold. Proposition 47 reaffirmed that threshold. The law doesn’t say there are no penalties for stealing under that amount: Misdemeanor theft carries penalties of up to six months in jail and a fine. Harris was California’s attorney general when voters approved the 2014 law. A spokesperson for a group that co-authored Proposition 47 said Harris had no involvement in crafting the bill. Experts and news reports show Harris remained publicly neutral on the initiative. A Trump spokesperson provided no evidence that Harris was responsible for drafting the law, or that people can steal without consequences.

politifact,Former President Donald Trump “cut overtime benefits for millions of workers.”,"The Obama administration set a rule in 2016 to raise the salary threshold for white-collar workers to receive overtime pay. The administration said the rule would extend overtime pay to 4.2 million workers.     A judge blocked the Obama rule in November 2016, before it took effect, and the incoming Trump administration did not challenge the court ruling, dropping the government’s appeal in 2017.     The Trump administration set its own rule to raise the salary threshold for overtime pay, but by less than Obama’s rule. The Trump administration said it would extend overtime pay to 1.2 million workers.","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told union workers in Los Angeles that a Trump-Vance administration would harm unions and diminish workers’ paychecks. Former President Donald Trump ""cut overtime benefits for millions of workers,"" Walz  said  at the Aug. 14 convention of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Walz mischaracterized what happened.  When contacted for comment, the Harris-Walz campaign pointed to news articles showing that former President Barack Obama proposed to extend overtime pay eligibility to more workers, but a  judge  blocked it in November 2016, just before it was slated to take effect. The Trump administration  did not challenge  the judge’s ruling and instead  set its own overtime rule , which extended overtime pay to millions fewer people than Obama’s rule would have done. The Obama rule was not in effect at the time Trump took office, so Trump’s administration did not cut an existing benefit.  Most employees are eligible  for time-and-a-half pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. But there are exceptions for white-collar workers.  To be  considered a white-collar worker  by the federal  government , an employee has to make more than $455 per week; be paid a salary rather than an hourly wage; and work in an administrative, executive or professional position.  The Obama administration sought to boost the baseline amount salaried white-collar workers could earn and still qualify for overtime. So, in 2016, the administration  said  it would extend overtime eligibility to white-collar salaried workers earning less than $913 a week, or $47,476 a year. This was about double the exemption level set in 2004 of $455 per week, or $23,660 a year. (Hourly workers were already guaranteed overtime pay regardless of their earnings level). The change would have extended overtime pay eligibility to  4.2 million additional Americans , the Obama administration said. (Economists  generated their own estimates , lower or higher, but still in the millions.) Republican-led states and business trade groups challenged the rule. A federal court in Texas  halted Obama’s rule  in November 2016, a week before it was to take effect.  Because the judge threw out the rule, the overtime threshold annual pay reverted to $23,660, said Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. A few months after the judge struck down the Obama rule, Trump took office. Trump’s administration  did not defend  the Obama-era rule change, dropping the government’s appeal in 2017.  The Trump administration proposed its own rule in 2019, with an earnings cutoff lower than the Obama rule but higher than the status quo.  The Trump Labor Department’s  overtime rule  became effective Jan. 1, 2020, and raised the overtime pay eligibility to salaried workers earning $35,568 per year. The department estimated that 1.2 million additional workers would be eligible for overtime pay.  It wasn’t the case that millions of workers previously qualified for overtime pay and then Trump changed that. The Trump administration did not defend the Obama-era legal case.  ""By abandoning the 2016 rule and eventually introducing a new one with a significantly lower salary threshold, the Trump administration excluded millions of workers who would have benefited from the 2016 rule’s new or strengthened overtime protections,"" said Jenn Round, director of Beyond the Bill, a program that advocates for labor standards enforcement at the Rutgers University Workplace Justice Lab. The president of the Economic Policy Institute, Heidi Shierholz, who served in the Obama administration as chief economist at the Labor Department,  wrote  in 2019 that the Trump administration’s rule left millions of workers behind. ""At its heart, the Trump administration’s rule is based on the notion that someone making $35,568 a year is a well-paid executive who doesn’t need or deserve overtime protections,"" Shierholz wrote. Rather than defend the Obama rule, ""Trump has sided with the interests of corporate executives over those of working people."" However, the notion that this represents a cut presumes that the courts would have upheld the Obama rule, which was far from a certainty. ""I cannot think of any way in which actions that the Trump Administration took could be construed as cutting overtime benefits,"" Greszler said. After the judge threw out Obama’s rule, the overtime threshold remained at $23,660, Greszler said. When Trump established a rule that increased the salary threshold to $35,568 ""this increased the number of workers subject to overtime rules,"" Greszler said. And the skirmish continues: The Biden-Harris administration set a rule, effective July 1, which initially raises the salary threshold for overtime pay to $844 per week, the equivalent of  $43,888  annually. The threshold rises to $58,656 per year on Jan. 1, 2025. There are currently  at least three lawsuits pending against that rule . Walz said Trump ""cut overtime benefits for millions of workers."" In 2016, the Obama administration set a rule that would have raised the salary threshold for overtime pay. It said the change would extend overtime pay to 4.2 million more workers. But a judge struck it down before it took effect, and the incoming Trump administration dropped a challenge against the ruling. The statement has an element of truth because the decision not to continue the judicial appeal process meant the Trump administration gave up on the possibility of providing overtime eligibility to millions more workers compared with the Obama-era rule. But categorizing it as a cut is misleading because it relies on the assumption that Obama’s more expansive rule would have been approved by the courts, which was not a certainty. Trump’s administration did not take action to cut an existing benefit; the Obama rule was not in effect at the time Trump took office.  We rate this Mostly False.",barely-true,Tim Walz,2024-08-14,2024-08-20,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Gov._Tim_Walz_speaks_at_campaign_rally_in_Las_Vegas_08-10-2024/d3821022400756cbd2ecc3c507324a3c.jpeg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/20/tim-walz/fact-check-tim-walz-misleads-about-trump-and-overt/,"National, Economy, Elections, Labor, Tim Walz"

Most immigrants living illegally in the U.S. are not eligible for benefits from federal programs, because the programs require Social Security numbers. Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are typically ineligible for federal Department of Housing and Urban Development housing programs.     The Vance campaign said immigrants could obtain Social Security numbers and qualify for the program. However, the program’s eligibility requirements have not yet been revealed.","Sen. JD Vance, former President Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, attacked Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign pledge to ease the burden costly down payments put on first-time homebuyers. ""Kamala Harris wants to give $25,000 to illegal aliens to buy American homes,"" the Ohio Republican wrote  Aug. 16 on X . ""This will only further exacerbate the housing shortage in our country. It's a disgrace. We should be making it easier and more affordable for American citizens to buy homes."" The Vance campaign pointed PolitiFact to Harris’ recently announced proposal that would provide up to $25,000 for first-time homebuyers to put toward a down payment on a home.  Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, debuted the plan at an Aug. 16 campaign rally. She didn’t discuss technicalities, so it’s unclear how the policy would be carried out or who could qualify for the assistance. Here’s what we know.  Without providing much detail, Harris pledged down payment assistance.  ""As the Harris-Walz plan starts to expand the supply of entry-level homes, they will, during their first term, provide working families who have paid their rent on time for two years and are buying their first home up to $25,000 in down payment assistance, with more generous support for first-generation homeowners,""  the campaign  said in an Aug. 16 press release.  Harris also mentioned the proposal — with less detail about who might qualify — at the aforementioned  campaign rally , Aug 16 in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""We also know that as the cost of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well,"" she said. ""Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough. So, in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time homebuyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home."" Harris did not provide many details on who would qualify, and it’s unclear what the proposed ""assistance"" would entail. Several news reports described it as ""assistance,"" The Washington Post  described  it as ""a $25,000 credit."" The Harris campaign did not address our questions seeking more detail. Harris’ plan  builds on  a similar  March  Biden proposal. Biden called on Congress to provide as much as $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers whose parents did not own homes. That plan is mentioned in the  2024 Democratic Party Platform , which Democrats formally  adopted Aug. 19  at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Under Harris’ plan, people whose parents owned homes would also qualify for assistance.  In March, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and six Democratic co-sponsors,  introduced   legislation  that would provide  up to $20,000  federal grants to help first-generation homebuyers with certain home purchase expenses, including their down payment and closing costs. Under the bill, a person would have  qualified  for grant assistance if he or she were a first-time and first-generation homebuyer whose income wasn’t more than 120% of the area’s median income (or 140% of the median income if the home being purchased was located in a high-cost area). Beyond that, the law’s implementation would depend on the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the state-level agencies administering the funding, a Warnock spokesperson said. That bill was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on  March 12 , where it awaits further action. The Harris campaign did not say whether Warnock’s legislation aligned with her plan.  The Vance campaign said that migrants who entered the U.S. illegally under the Biden-Harris administration could, over time, qualify for Harris’ down payment assistance proposal.  For example, the Vance campaign told us that migrants awaiting a decision on their asylum claim — which could take years given the  immigration court backlog  — can be issued work permits and Social Security numbers.  The Social Security Administration says that  typically  ""only noncitizens authorized to work in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can get an SSN.""  A 2023 Congressional Research Service  report  found that ""unauthorized noncitizens"" — meaning foreign nationals who entered the U.S. ""without inspection,"" ""with fraudulent documents"" or who entered legally but overstayed ""the terms of their temporary stay"" —  are not eligible  for employment authorization or a work authorized Social Security number.  The Social Security Administration can issue Social Security numbers that are  ""not valid for employment""  to some noncitizens who are not authorized by the Department of Homeland Security to work in the U.S. if a federal law requires the noncitizen have a Social Security number to receive a benefit or service. Most immigrants living illegally in the U.S.  are not eligible for benefits from federal programs , because the programs require Social Security numbers. Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are  typically   ineligible  for federal Department of Housing and Urban Development housing programs. Vance said   ""Harris wants to give $25,000 to illegal aliens to buy American homes."" The GOP vice presidential nominee is filling in blanks about a proposal that we know little about.  Harris has pledged to provide ""working families who have paid their rent on time for two years"" who are first-time homebuyers with $25,000 in down payment assistance. She has not detailed what the policy would entail or who would qualify. The Vance campaign argued that migrants could get Social Security numbers that might qualify them for down payment assistance. Social Security numbers are typically given only to noncitizens who are authorized to work in the U.S. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker.

She remained seated when the crowd cheered for her during remarks praising her by Ashley Biden, President Joe Biden’s daughter.     Harris visited Madison, Wisconsin, in March to promote Joe Biden’s agenda. News coverage of the day’s events do not mention Harris appearing drunk.     Two social media videos claiming Harris was drunk at these events provide no evidence supporting the claims.","Vice President Kamala Harris’ critics on social media have long shared video clips of the Democratic presidential nominee speaking and  insinuating  she may be  drunk  or high. Many of the social media  posts  shared  clips  of Harris’  comments  that have gone viral and said they show Harris  was drunk  — such as when Harris  described  her mother asking, ""You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?"" Two social media posts shared recently claim to show Harris was intoxicated at public events. One is from the Democratic National Convention’s first night. The other is from a March visit by Harris to Madison, Wisconsin. The first post shared a video of Harris remaining seated on the first night of the DNC in Chicago as those around her stood and applauded. ""Kamala Harris appears to be too intoxicated to stand up. This is getting bad,"" the Aug. 19  X post  said. An Aug. 18  Instagram post  shared a video of Harris speaking in Madison with text that said, ""BREAKING: Multiple police officers have come forward stating that Kamala is 100% intoxicated in this clip and she would’ve been charged with a DUI if she had been behind the wheel of a car."" PolitiFact  has examined  similar claims before about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whom critics often accused of being drunk at public events — even though she doesn’t drink alcohol. We decided to look closer at these two videos to see whether there’s any evidence to back the claims Harris was drunk at these events. In the shortened DNC video clip shared on X, Ashley Biden, President Joe Biden’s daughter, spoke before introducing her father. Ashley Biden praised Harris, who was sitting, and said, ""She will beat Donald Trump again."" The camera showed a smiling Harris sitting in the audience. Harris stayed seated, patted her chest and mouthed ""thank you"" as those around her, including running mate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., stood and applauded for her. A  PBS video  of her speech, seen below, shows Ashley Biden praising Harris shortly before introducing her father, saying, ""In 2020, my dad selected Kamala Harris to beat Donald Trump. And he knows, in 2024, she will beat Donald Trump again."" Harris remained seated as the crowd cheered. But, minutes later,  another video  shows Harris stood and cheered as Joe Biden took the stage. After Biden’s speech, Harris walked onstage to greet him. Does sitting while others stood mean Harris was too drunk to stand? No. It’s not unusual for someone who is being applauded to remain seated, and the cheers were for Harris.  The full video of the DNC’s first night, as you’ll see in the clips below, shows Harris standing to applaud others several times. About three hours into the video, Harris appeared onstage briefly to greet the crowd and praise Joe Biden. She stood steadily and did not appear to stumble or slurring her words. Later in the evening, Harris again stood and applauded as Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., praised Joe Biden. Harris again stood and applauded as former first lady Jill Biden took the stage. The second video we’re examining is from Harris’ visit in March to Madison, Wisconsin, where she promoted a Biden executive order aimed at expanding apprenticeship programs and union jobs. In the Aug. 18 Instagram  video , Harris discusses democracy as ominous music plays in the background. Text above the video said police officers had determined that Harris was intoxicated. We traced the video to an  X account  with more than 311,000 followers, where it had been viewed 11 million times, according to X. Neither post shared any evidence that police officers have ""come forward"" to say that Harris was intoxicated.  The same X account, run by a  self-described  Trump supporter,  shared another video  that claimed Pelosi dropped a bag of cocaine onstage Aug. 21 at the DNC. It appeared to be a  piece of paper  that fell. In searching Google and the Nexis news database, we found no legitimate news stories about police officers making the Harris-was-intoxicated claim. The full video, which was from remarks Harris  gave to Biden-Harris campaign workers  in Madison, is below. Harris first appears at the 6:17 mark; the part seen in the Instagram video begins at the 12:40 mark. Harris’  visit  was  widely   covered  by local  media outlets , none of which mentioned that Harris seemed intoxicated.  According to a  press pool report , Harris arrived at about 11:30 a.m. CDT at Dane County Regional Airport in Madison and headed to the future Madison Metro Transit Facility site, where she  spoke . She then visited her childhood home in Madison, where she  lived  from age 3 to age 5,  before stopping at the Wisconsin Democrats’ headquarters, where she spoke to campaign workers.  Two social media posts claimed Harris was intoxicated at public events. One said she was too drunk to stand on the DNC’s first night. Another said without evidence that police officers came forward to say Harris was intoxicated at a visit to Madison, Wisconsin, in March.

politifact,"Says U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin ""believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion.""","U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis.’ office pointed to U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., voting against various amendments regarding abortion and introducing the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act of 2023, which would provide grants to organizations that transport pregnant women to receive an abortion.     The proposed legislation would also provide funding for childcare, meals, lost wages and doula care.     But it specifically states funding cannot be used for an abortion procedure.","Long before Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race was set in the August primary, voters had been hearing about the top two candidates and their stance on issues like abortion.  U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., called out U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., on abortion in an interview on UpFront on WISN-TV in April.  When asked about Donald Trump’s position on abortion, Steil said: ""At the national level what we’re often talking about is whether taxpayer dollars should be used. You have someone like Tammy Baldwin that believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion. And somebody like me that comes down on the side of life.""  To be clear, Baldwin is running against Republican Eric Hovde, a madison businessman, not Steil, who is in his own race against Democrat Peter Barca.  But is Steil right that Baldwin supports using taxpayer money for abortions?  When we asked Steil’s office for evidence, his staff noted that Baldwin voted against the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act in January 2019. Baldwin’s vote contributed to the measure failing in the Senate.  A January 2019 story from Politico called the vote on the legislation ""a largely symbolic effort timed to coincide with the country’s largest annual anti-abortion demonstration in Washington."" Asked if Baldwin supported tax dollars paying for abortions, Baldwin campaign spokesman Andrew Mamo did not answer the question directly, stating only Baldwin ""will always vote to support womens’ freedom to make their own health care decisions."" Meanwhile, Steil’s office also pointed us to two amendments in 2021 proposed by U.S. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., related to the potential use of taxpayer dollars for abortions that Baldwin voted against. But in the way Washington operates, there can be many reasons for a no vote – from opposition to cost to other items in the measure, or as a response to political maneuvering.  Finally, Steil’s office also pointed to Baldwin introducing a bill in the Senate dubbed the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act of 2023.  According to the text of the bill, the measure would ""authorize grants to eligible entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals seeking abortion services, and for other purposes."" The proposed legislation offers funding for organizations that work with pregnant women on things such as  travel, meals, logistics, childcare, patient education and even doula care.  It’s clear by its own description that taxpayer funds could be used to help people who are trying to get an abortion. However, the bill also states that ""an eligible entity receiving a grant under this section shall not use the grant for costs of an abortion procedure."" So, it’s far from as clear cut as Steil tried to make it. Steil claimed Baldwin ""believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion.""  His office pointed to several bills and amendments related to abortion as evidence, but none are directly on point.  The central piece of evidence he cited is a bill Baldwin introduced that would provide funding for travel costs and other aspects of reproductive healthcare, including access to abortion —but the same bill specifically states the federal funding cannot be used for an abortion procedure.  Baldwin, meanwhile, does not help her own case, in that a spokesperson did not directly answer if the senator was in favor of taxpayer funds paying for abortions.  Our definition of Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here. ",half-true,Bryan Steil,2024-04-28,2024-08-26,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Abortion_rights_MJS/4d63a5e767fa2cbd65ddb7c8091d2cba.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/26/bryan-steil/us-rep-steils-spin-on-us-sen-baldwin-on-abortion-a/,"Abortion, Elections, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Bryan Steil"

politifact,"“Kamala cast the tiebreaking vote to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go after your tip income.”","Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate in 2022 to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. That bill gave an additional $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service.     A 2021 Treasury Department report said that the IRS would use money to hire about 87,000 new workers over a decade. But they were not all for enforcement. And it did not plan to increase audits for households earning less than $400,000.     In 2023, the IRS proposed a new tip reporting program for service industry employers to report tips voluntarily to aid tax compliance. It was structured to replace preexisting programs but was never adopted.","Former President Donald Trump called Vice President Kamala Harris a ""copycat"" for showing support for a no-tax-on-tips plan. Trump said Harris’ stance conflicts with her voting record. Trump campaigned on eliminating tip taxes June 9 during a  rally in Las Vegas . On  Aug. 11 , Harris also endorsed the concept at a Las Vegas. With  more than 22%  of Nevada’s workforce employed by the service and hospitality industry, the issue of taxes on tips is of  high interest in this battleground state .  On Aug. 23 at a Las Vegas restaurant,  Trump said:  ""Kamala cast the tiebreaking vote to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go after your tip income.""  Two days later, Trump unveiled  an ad  that said, ""Harris and Biden have literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips."" The ad shows a fearful homeowner as workers in suits arrive to comb through her house. In August, we  debunked a similar viral statement on Instagram  about Harris and tipped income.  Harris cast the tiebreaking vote  on the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, but the law did not lay out a plan to send 87,000 agents after tipped workers. And a 2023 IRS proposal to replace programs for taxed tip compliance was never implemented. The 2022  Inflation Reduction Act  increased taxes on large corporations and gave an additional $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service.  The claim that the IRS would hire 87,000 IRS agents came from a 2021 Department of Treasury  report  that said the IRS would use the $80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire 86,852 full-time employees by 2031.  But not all those jobs are for enforcement. In 2023, the IRS used money from the Inflation Reduction Act to pay for  13,661 positions, including 495 for enforcement.  From 2024 to 2030, the agency expects to hire about 32,500 more for enforcement. In total, for all jobs including enforcement, operations and taxpayer services, the IRS plans to hire about 53,000 employees from 2023 to 2030. The agency has said it focuses enforcement against large corporations and wealthy taxpayers. The IRS said it had  collected more than $1 billion  from high-wealth taxpayers with past-due taxes since the law’s passage. The Treasury Department previously  said  audits will not increase for households earning less than the $400,000 threshold. The  median wage  for waiters and waitresses is about $31,940, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — far below that threshold.  The Trump campaign pointed to a  March 2022 CBS report  that low-income households with less than $25,000 in annual earnings are more than five times as likely to be audited by the IRS as everyone else. The data came from an  analysis  by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University that preceded President Joe Biden’s signing of the Inflation Reduction Act into law.  Susan Long, TRAC’s co-director and a professor of managerial statistics at Syracuse University, told us that the higher audit rates were driven by the ""IRS targeting low income families claiming an earned income credit — not anything directly related to tip income per se.""  In February 2023, the IRS proposed a new  tip reporting program  that would let service industry employers report tips voluntarily to help with tax compliance. The Service Industry Tip Compliance Agreement program aimed to use advancements in point-of-sale, time and attendance systems, and electronic payment settlement methods to improve tip reporting compliance.  The proposal was intended to replace three tip compliance agreements that have existed since  1993 . The agency never adopted it. ""Treasury and the IRS have no plans to move forward with the voluntary program and, as such, there are no new reporting or compliance components,"" Treasury spokesperson Ashley Schapitl said. ""We continue to carefully consider comments received in response to the proposed guidance."" Erica York, a senior economist and research director with Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, said the Inflation Reduction Act did not change the tax treatment of tips.  ""Tips have been reportable as income for decades and decades,"" York said in an email. She pointed to a  form from 1966  that reminded taxpayers to include tips when reporting their income. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 ""introduced more stringent rules for tip reporting in an effort to crack down on underreporting,"" York said. (But  York added that  that law wasn’t the start of taxing tips.) The IRS established agreements in the late 1990s and early 2000s for industries such as restaurants and casinos to enhance tax compliance among tipped employees and their employers through taxpayer education, instead of auditing. ​​A 2018 Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration study found that of the employers with tip reporting agreements that filed 2016 tax year forms, 30% had projected unreported tips totaling close to $1.66 billion. The Trump campaign pointed to  news   articles  and the  Americans for Tax Reform  report that took a dim view of the tips compliance proposal. But York also told us, ""The new program wouldn’t change what tipped workers owe on their income."" ""My understanding is that the proposed program has been in development for a number of years, potentially  dating back to this 2013 proposal from the IRS ."" Trump said Harris ""cast the tiebreaking vote to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to go after your tip income."" But his statement conflates and distorts two different policy proposals — one of which did not become reality — and misleadingly characterizes Harris’ position.   In 2022, Harris cast a tiebreaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $80 billion for the IRS. Although the Treasury Department had previously said the money would be used to hire about 87,000 workers, that was not all for enforcement. And the law didn’t state the IRS would pursue tipped workers. The agency is hiring enforcement workers, but fewer than Trump said. In 2023, there were 13,661 IRS workers who were funded through the Inflation Reduction Act including 495 for enforcement. From 2023 to 2030, the agency plans to hire about 32,500 for enforcement through the act.  In 2023, the IRS proposed a new program for service industry employers to report tips voluntarily to aid tax compliance. But the IRS has no plans to proceed with that proposal.  We rate his statement False.  RELATED :  No, Jacky Rosen didn’t say ending taxes on tips would hurt Nevada families",false,Donald Trump,2024-08-23,2024-08-28,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/servers_tips_8_27_2024/0fc732605c6a56497ba1863fa94fcf23.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/28/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-falsely-said-harris-voted-to-hire/,"National, Nevada, Elections, Poverty, Taxes, Donald Trump"

politifact,The order of candidate names on North Carolina’s ballot shows a “clear attempt at voter manipulation.”,Vice President Kamala Harris’ and other presidential candidates’ names appear above Donald Trump’s on North Carolina’s ballot. The order of names is chosen at random before every election.  Trump’s name appeared first on the ballot in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.,"A social media post claims that North Carolina’s ballot for the November election has been ""manipulated"" to hurt former President Donald Trump. ""Reports show Trump is poised to appear near the bottom of the ballot in North Carolina,"" the  Aug. 27 post  says on X, formerly Twitter. ""This is indefensible and a clear attempt at voter manipulation."" A day after the claim was posted, it had been viewed nearly 1 million times. Pundits and political strategists pay attention to the order of names on a ballot because candidates whose names are listed first tend to perform better than candidates whose names are listed further down the ballot,  researchers   have   found .  The names of some of Trump’s presidential election opponents do appear higher than Trump’s on the North Carolina ballot. But there’s no evidence that the ballot was manipulated. North Carolina  state law  requires the order of candidates’ names to be determined by a drawing, and election officials have used the same process for many years. For this year’s election, the state board  conducted the drawing  Dec. 15.  First, election officials place 26 balls, each labeled with a letter of the alphabet, in a bingo wheel.An election official spins the wheel until a ball comes out. This year, the ball showed the letter D. Then, election officials flip a coin to see whether candidates will be listed in alphabetical order (heads) or reverse alphabetical order (tails).  This year, the coin showed heads, meaning the candidates would appear on ballots in alphabetical order, starting with the letter D. The candidates are sorted by last name.  That’s how the state elections board determined that the candidates would appear in the following order: D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, A, B, C. As a result, the names of five presidential candidates — Kamala Harris, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Chase Oliver, Jill Stein, and Randall Terry — appear above Trump’s name on the ballot.  Kennedy recently suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump. However, his name remains on the ballot because the We The People party — which nominated Kennedy —  has not asked  the state elections board to remove his name from the ballot. If President Joe Biden hadn’t dropped out of the race, his name would have appeared on the ballot last. Trump had better luck in previous drawings, appearing first on the ballot in both the  2016  and  2020  elections.  In  2020 , candidates’ names appeared alphabetically starting with the letter O. In  2016 , candidates’ names appeared alphabetically starting with the letter H.

En la  versión corta  del video de la Convención Nacional Demócrata compartido en X, Ashley Biden, la hija del presidente Joe Biden, habló antes de presentar a su padre. Ashley Biden elogió a Harris, que estaba sentada, y dijo: ""Ella volverá a vencer a Donald Trump"". La cámara mostró a Harris sonriendo sentada entre el público. Harris permaneció sentada, se dio una palmadita en el pecho y dijo ""gracias"" mientras quienes la rodeaban, incluyendo a su compañero de fórmula, el gobernador Tim Walz, demócrata de Minnesota, se pararon y la aplaudieron. Un  video de PBS  muestra a Harris sentada durante el elogio. Pero, minutos después,  otro video  muestra a Harris parada y aplaudiendo mientras Joe Biden subía al escenario. Después del discurso de Biden, Harris subió al escenario para saludarlo. ¿Sentarse mientras otros están de pie significa que Harris estaba demasiado borracha para levantarse? No. No es inusual que alguien que está siendo aplaudido permanezca sentado, y los aplausos eran para Harris. El video completo de la primera noche de la Convención Nacional Demócrata, como se ve en las imágenes a continuación, muestra a Harris de pie aplaudiendo varias veces. Aproximadamente tres horas después de que comenzara el video, Harris apareció brevemente en el escenario para saludar a la multitud y elogiar a Joe Biden. Se mantuvo firme y no pareció tropezar ni tener dificultad para hablar. Luego en la noche, Harris de nuevo se puso de pie y aplaudió al senador Raphael Warnock, demócrata de Georgia, elogiando a Joe Biden.  Harris se paró nuevamente y aplaudió cuando la ex primera dama Jill Biden subió al escenario. El segundo video que estamos examinando es de la visita de Harris en marzo a Madison, donde promovió una orden ejecutiva de Biden destinada a expandir los programas de aprendizaje y los empleos sindicales. En el video en Facebook del 21 de agosto, Harris habla sobre la democracia mientras suena una música de noticiero de fondo. Y el narrador del video dice que hay una gran división en el partido demócrata por el supuesto abuso al alcohol de Harris. El  video  proviene de una  cuenta en TikTok  con más de 80,000 seguidores, donde el video ha tenido más de 577,000 vistas, según TikTok.  Ninguna de las publicaciones mostró evidencia de miembros del partido demócrata diciendo que Harris está abusando del alcohol.  Al buscar en  Google  y en el archivo de noticias  Nexis , no encontramos noticias legítimas sobre miembros del partido demócrata diciendo que Harris estaba intoxicada. El video completo, que incluye declaraciones de Harris a los trabajadores de  la campaña de Biden-Harris  en Madison, se encuentra abajo. Harris aparece por primera vez en el minuto 6:17; la parte que se ve en el video de Facebook comienza en el minuto 12:40. La  visita  de Harris tuvo  amplia   cobertura  de los medios de  comunicación locales , ninguno de los cuales mencionó que Harris parecía estar ebria. Según un  informe de la prensa , Harris llegó alrededor de las 11:30 a.m. hora central al Aeropuerto Regional del Condado de Dane en Madison y se dirigió a lo que va a ser el Madison Metro Transit Facility, donde ella  habló . Luego visitó la casa de su infancia en Madison, donde  vivió  desde los 3 a los 5 años, antes de detenerse en la sede de los demócratas de Wisconsin, donde habló con los trabajadores de la campaña. Publicaciones en redes sociales dijeron que Harris estaba ebria en eventos públicos. Una dijo que estaba demasiado borracha para estar de pie en la primera noche de la Convención Nacional Demócrata. Otra dijo, sin pruebas, que miembros demócratas critican fuertemente el abuso al consumo de alcohol de Harris y mostró un video ella en una visita a Madison.

Anything that you lose on the tariff from the perspective of the consumer, you gain in higher wages, so you're ultimately much better off."" When contacted for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesperson cited a study by  Coalition for a Prosperous America , a group of manufacturers and labor unions that generally supports higher tariffs. The study says a 10% tariff ""would stimulate domestic production and raise economic growth to produce a 5.7% increase in real income for the average American household."" Most economists disagree with this idea. Our previous review of academic studies of real-world tariffs  concluded  that consumers ultimately shoulder most of the burden in higher prices for goods, and the burden outweighs tariffs’ economic benefits. ""In any profession that includes more than 20,000 members, there will be disagreement, and I’m sure Sen. Vance can recruit some adherents to his views,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a think tank. But, Burtless said, ""the great majority of economists favor freer trade policies,"" which means fewer tariffs.  The idea behind imposing tariffs is to make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, by increasing prices on imported goods and therefore making domestic goods more attractive to consumers. As American companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and increase employees’ pay. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, spreading those dollars around the economy more broadly. Economists have told us, however, that real-world examples of tariffs working as intended are rare. Consumers in the tariff-levying country are on the losing end of the deals, by having to pay higher prices, they said. When the tariff levied is small, an importer may choose to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But that is not a certainty. ""Tariffs artificially raise the cost of doing business, which depresses overall economic production in the form of lower gross domestic product, artificially higher prices, and fewer goods sold,"" Boise State University political scientist Ross Burkhart, who studies trade policy, told PolitiFact. ""For the consumer, this means a reduction in purchasing power."" Tariffs also mean that producers pay more as prices rise for materials used to make products domestically.  ""There are far more jobs in industries that use steel as an input than there are steelmaker jobs,"" Daniel Mitchell, an  independent  libertarian economist, told PolitiFact. And higher input costs are also likely to be passed on to consumers, economists said. Meanwhile, U.S. producers can expect to face retaliatory tariffs, which can also raise prices for U.S. consumers. And a decline in international competition hurts consumers by enabling the remaining producers to raise prices. There is also evidence that because lower-income Americans tend to spend a larger portion of their income on goods, they feel the pinch from tariffs more so than affluent Americans. ""Economists will disagree about the exact amount of harm this inflicts on consumers and the U.S. economy more generally,"" Burtless said. ""But most of us probably agree there will be at least some reduction in our standard of living, at least eventually."" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right group, called tariffs an ""unambiguous negative for consumers,"" and said ""there is vast empirical literature to buttress this conclusion.""  Studies of past tariff impacts on consumers, jobs and wages include:  The  Tax Foundation , a center-right group, found in a 2024 study that tariffs on thousands of products — enacted under Trump and continued under President Joe Biden — reduced employment by 142,000 full-time equivalent jobs, while also shaving 0.2% off gross domestic product. (GDP is the market value of all the goods and services a country produces.) A 2024  paper  published by researchers from Cornell, Yale, Duke and New York universities found that tariffs on imported solar panels were depressing employment and wages. Lifting the tariffs, the authors concluded, would have increased domestic employment and wages on net. A 2020 UCLA  study  calculated consumer losses of $51 billion from Trump tariffs through 2019, which was greater than gains to producers and the federal Treasury from tariff payments. A 2019  study  for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the costs of Trump’s tariff fell entirely on domestic consumers, with a $1.4 billion-per-month reduction in U.S. inflation-adjusted income by the end of 2018. ""Tariffs generally hurt consumers by raising prices and distorting the market,"" Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist said. ""They may help specific areas and industries, and they may look like a small per-person cost, but they're generally very high cost on a per-job saved or created basis."" Sinclair and other economists acknowledged that tariffs can make sense in limited cases, such as for national security reasons. There’s also a case to be made for protecting domestic producers that face sudden overseas competition, said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. But even in those scenarios, it requires ""carefully thinking through which sectors are being protected, rather than blanket protection,"" Baker said. There is little disagreement on this question among credentialed economists, according to surveys. In 1990, 2000, 2011 and 2021, researchers  surveyed  members of the American Economic Association, a professional group for economists, to gauge consensus among the group’s members on a range of economic propositions. One proposition asked whether ""tariffs and import quotas usually reduce general economic welfare."" In each of the surveys spanning three decades, 94% to 95% of economists surveyed agreed that tariffs reduced general economic welfare. Vance said, ""Anything that you lose on the tariff from the perspective of the consumer, you gain in higher wages, so you're ultimately much better off."" The majority of economists believe the negative impacts from tariffs, including higher costs, consistently outweigh the benefits for consumers. Academic and think tank studies on tariffs’ effects bolster the economists’ views.

politifact,"“This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states.”","Three Republican-led states — Alabama, Texas and Virginia — have taken steps to remove or flag ineligible people on the voter rolls, since at least 2021. This included noncitizens, or potential noncitizens, according to state officials.     There are some unknowns about the people affected, and the number of people who turn out to be noncitizens could change.     Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections in 1996. Noncitizens rarely cast ballots. If they do, they face stiff penalties including jail time, deportation or denial of citizenship applications.","Republican politicians from multiple states say noncitizen voting is rampant and they are doing whatever they can to stop it. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., wants lawmakers to vote on a  federal bill  that aims to prevent noncitizen voting. Congress blocked noncitizens from voting in federal elections in 1996. ""Illegals SHOULD NOT BE VOTING in American elections,""  Scott  wrote Aug. 28 on X, linking to a clip of an interview with Newsmax. ""This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states. It’s a serious problem — and as the next Senate GOP Leader I’ll make sure we fix it."" Scott, who is running for reelection this year, wants to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the Senate Republican leader. Despite  evidence  that noncitizen voting is rare,  Republicans  and  social media influencers  are making it a cornerstone of their election-year messaging. Scott’s Senate office confirmed that he was referring to voters in Texas, Virginia and Alabama.  We found that Scott’s number has some merit, but he misconstrued some of the details: Scott said the removals happened in August. Republican state officials in these states announced their actions only this month. Texas and Virginia officials said they had been removed during the past few years.  Scott used the word ""removed."" Texas and Virginia officials said they removed the voters. But Alabama moved them from active to inactive status. Alabama’s secretary of state said some of the people might have since become naturalized citizens and are therefore eligible to vote if they update their information.  Texas called the voters ""potential noncitizens."" It’s unclear how many of the 16,000 people voted in an election The voters flagged for citizenship questions add up to less than 1% of those states’ voter rolls. Here is what we know about the efforts to remove noncitizen voters in three states:  Texas : Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Aug. 26 that the state removed about 1 million ineligible people from the voter rolls since 2021. Most of them were removed because they had died or moved or didn’t respond to notices sent by election officials.  Additionally, Abbott wrote, ""of the over 6,500 potential noncitizens removed from the voter rolls, approximately 1,930 have a voter history."" Those 1,930 were sent to the state attorney general for potential legal action. The word ""potential"" raises the question about whether they were proved to be noncitizens. The  Dallas Morning News , a PolitiFact Texas partner, reported that those 6,500 people were sent a  notice that their voter registration was under examination but did not respond.  The notice states that they had 30 days to provide information or documentation establishing their qualifications for voter registration. A previous effort to clean up Texas’ voter rolls went poorly in 2019 when the state started with an error-filled  list of 95,000  potential noncitizens on the voter rolls. The effort led to lawsuits and the secretary of state’s resignation. This time, Texas’ list is much smaller. Alabama : Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen said in an Aug. 13 statement that his office identified ""3,251 individuals who are registered to vote in Alabama who have been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security."" Allen did not say how many voted.  Allen instructed county boards of registrars to change the status for those voters to inactive and begin removing noncitizens from the rolls. Allen sent the list to the state’s attorney general for potential prosecution. Allen said it’s possible that some of the people have since become naturalized citizens and are therefore eligible to vote; but they have to update their information. Barry Stephenson, chairman of Jefferson County’s Board of Registrars, told PolitiFact his county had 557 voters on that list.  ""They are not being removed — they are moving from active status to inactive,"" Stephenson said. As long as they fill out the form attesting to their citizenship, they can vote. Stephenson told PolitiFact that a couple of people who received a notice called the office and said that they had green cards and didn’t know they were registered to vote. They said they never asked to register to vote while getting a driver’s license. Jefferson County has 47,000 people on the inactive list, so the names the state flagged for citizenship are a small slice.  Virginia : Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in an Aug. 7 executive order that the state removed 6,303 noncitizens from voter rolls from January 2022 to July 2024. Youngkin’s order did not say whether any people cast ballots. Virginia used state Department of Motor Vehicles records and federal Department of Homeland Security data to identify noncitizens. Youngkin’s order stated that they may have ""purposefully or accidentally registered to vote."" Elections experts say it is possible for an ineligible voter to accidentally register to vote at the DMV, which could be a mistake by the applicant or the clerk. And it’s possible DMV records on citizenship are outdated. ""All they know is what your citizenship status was whenever you interacted with the DMV,"" said Jonathan Diaz, an election law expert at the Campaign Legal Center, which promotes voting access. (The center has sent letters to  Alabama  and Texas officials challenging their recent actions.)   Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, agreed with Diaz: ""The fact that a voter was, at some point, not a citizen, certainly does not mean they voted during the time they were not a citizen."" In 1996, Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections as part of a  broader toughening of penalties  on people in the country illegally. ""Noncitizens"" includes people legally and illegally in the U.S. Safeguards already exist to prevent noncitizen voting. When people register to vote, they attest that they are citizens.  Think tanks,   academics ,  courts  and  journalists  have  analyzed  claims about noncitizen voting  at least since 2016  and have found only  sporadic cases  that wouldn’t swing federal elections. Penalties for noncitizen voting can include jail time, deportation or denial of citizenship applications.  One of the largest examples we could find of noncitizens charged for voting stems from North Carolina. In 2020, federal prosecutors  charged 19 people  in North Carolina with voter fraud after they cast ballots mostly in the 2016 election. Sixteen people pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen. Three cases were dismissed.  More than 4.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2016 presidential election. State election officials routinely take steps to remove ineligible people from the voter rolls in  accordance with federal law.   It could take several months or longer for authorities to determine whether any of the people the three states found on the voter rolls will face criminal charges. Additional information about these efforts could come out in potential lawsuits, meaning it could be years before some unknowns about the current removals are answered. Scott said, ""This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states.""  Scott is talking about something that did happen, but there is a lot we don’t know about the 16,000 total from available information. The outcome of investigations and potential lawsuits could take months or years.  Based on what we know, Scott’s timeframe is off. Not all of these voters were taken off the rolls in August. State officials announced actions related to these voters in August. Texas announced it had removed 6,500 ""potential noncitizens"" since 2021. The word ""potential"" leaves some wiggle room. Virginia said it had ""removed"" 6,303 voters since 2022.  The names in Alabama — 3,251 — were moved from active to inactive status, but that’s not the same as being removed. They can still vote as long as they sign a form attesting that they are U.S. citizens. Being on the voter rolls and casting a ballot are not the same thing. We don’t know how many of the potential noncitizen voters cast ballots; Texas said 1,930 had a Texas voter history. When we add up the numbers on the lists in the three states, it amounts to less than 1% of registered voters.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she isn’t buying the Republican presidential ticket’s position on abortion.  NBC ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker  asked Warren on Aug. 25  what she thought of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, saying in an earlier interview that Trump wouldn’t  sign a federal abortion ban .  Warren said, ""American women are not stupid,"" and that the candidates have an anti-abortion track record. ""JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, ‘enforce the Comstock Act,’"" Warren said. ""And remember, he did that, and then Donald Trump picked him to be his vice president."" The Comstock Act  is an 1873 antivice law that bans the mailing of ""obscene"" materials used in abortions. Anti-abortion advocates have tried to resurrect the law to prohibit sending materials such as abortion-inducing medication and surgical equipment. In January 2023, Vance joined about 40 congressional Republicans in sending a  letter  urging the U.S. Justice Department to enforce the Comstock Act to crack down on mailing abortion pills, which are used in the  majority of U.S. abortions .  The letter Vance signed was in response to the release of a Justice Department  memo  saying U.S. law doesn’t prohibit the mailing of abortion medication as long as the sender doesn’t intend for the medication to be used illegally.  ""Because there are manifold ways in which recipients in every state may lawfully use such drugs, including to produce an abortion, the mere mailing of such drugs to a particular jurisdiction is an insufficient basis for concluding that the sender intends them to be used unlawfully,"" Christopher Schroeder, assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in the Dec. 23, 2022, memo. The Justice Department was studying the question after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and the U.S. Postal Service asked the department to address whether the Comstock Act criminalizes the mailing of mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug regimen for a medication abortion.  But Vance and other Republicans said the Justice Department’s interpretation departed from the law’s plain-text meaning.  ""We demand that you act swiftly and in accordance with the law, shut down all mail-order abortion operations,"" Vance and fellow Republican lawmakers wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Signatories included current House Speaker Mike Johnson from Louisiana, Florida Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The Republicans cited other federal criminal conspiracy and money laundering laws and asked the department to rescind or redraft the memo. They said department officials should hold accountable physicians, pharmacists and others ""who break the Federal mail-order abortion laws"" and demanded it cease its efforts to ""prevent States from regulating or prohibiting abortion drugs."" On July 7 , Vance told NBC he supported access to abortion medication, citing a June Supreme Court ruling that left mifepristone on the market. But the court rejected a legal challenge of the pill’s FDA approval on procedural grounds, not on the case’s merits. Thus, the court could face the question again.  Since becoming the Republican vice presidential nominee, Vance hasn’t weighed in specifically on the Comstock Act.

There are fewer than 10,000 people in the U.S. with a net worth of at least $100 million.","Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign recently said she supports a proposed policy aimed at the ultrawealthy that President Joe Biden has pushed for years: a new tax on unrealized capital gains, or unsold assets that have increased in value.

Harris’ opponent, former President Donald Trump,  said  at an Aug. 23 campaign rally in Las Vegas that this unrealized capital gains tax ""will soon be applied to small business owners and you will be forced to sell your restaurant immediately."" Harris’ official campaign account, Kamala HQ,  responded on X  that the tax would apply only to people with $100 million in wealth. Harris has not released any tax policies. Harris’ campaign said she supports tax provisions in Biden’s 2025 budget proposal, including a tax on unrealized capital gains,  Axios ,  The New York Times  and  The Wall Street Journal  reported. When PolitiFact contacted the Harris campaign for more information about Harris’ tax plan, the campaign declined to comment, pointing instead to reporting from  Axios  and Minneapolis-based news outlet  KMSP-TV . Biden’s budget  proposes  tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans; it would not raise taxes for people earning less than $400,000 a year. One of Biden’s proposals is a 25% minimum tax on income, including unrealized capital gains, for taxpayers with a net worth — meaning assets minus liabilities — of more than $100 million. If instituted, the White House  said , this so-called billionaires tax would apply only to the wealthiest 0.01% of Americans — not the vast majority of the country’s taxpayers. In the U.S., there are about 9,850 centimillionaires, or people with at least $100 million in wealth, according to a  March 2024 report  from Henley & Partners, a wealth and migration advisory firm, and New World Wealth, a global wealth research firm. So, of this small ultrawealthy group, only the people who have more than 20% of their wealth in tradable assets — for example, publicly traded stock — would pay taxes on unrealized capital gains, Biden’s budget proposal states. Taxpayers with more than 80% of their wealth in nontradable assets, such as real estate and shares in private startups, would be considered ""illiquid."" These taxpayers could choose to include only unrealized gain in tradable assets when determining how much they owe in taxes, according to the budget proposal.  Currently,  capital gains  are taxed only after a realized event, such as when someone sells an asset. If an asset remains unrealized — never sold — it’s not subject to taxes. Some economists said an unrealized capital gains tax would promote more equity in the tax code. ""As it is now, normal workers are taxed on their entire income, but we have a situation where the very rich can have hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of capital gains which go altogether untaxed,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder and senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Wealthy people can hold stocks until they die, and then pass the assets to their heirs without paying taxes as long as their gains are unrealized, Baker said. Biden’s budget proposal argues that tax-free accumulation of wealth over generations exacerbates income-and-wealth disparities in the U.S. Adam Michel, tax policy studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute, said an unrealized capital gains tax would  overly burden the Internal Revenue Service and would discourage investment in burgeoning businesses. ""Such a system would encourage investors to put their money in safer investments, such as government bonds, rather than new innovative industries, like new energy sources, biopharmaceuticals, or AI,"" Michel said. Economic experts told PolitiFact that this proposed tax change is not certain, even if Harris wins the presidency. Any changes would require congressional approval, and control of the House and Senate will also be decided in November. It’s also unclear whether a wealth tax, such as this one, would  survive   legal challenges . Social media posts claimed Harris’ ""plan to tax unrecognized Capital Gains mean(s) if your house goes up in value you will have to pay that Tax Even if you don’t sell your House."" That claim ignores several critical facts about Harris’ plan, which is derived from Biden’s 2025 budget proposal. Most crucially: Most Americans wouldn’t have to pay a tax on the appreciated value of their unsold assets and this tax would apply only to people with more than $100 million in wealth. That’s fewer than 10,000 people in the U.S. Although this tax would affect the country’s top 0.01% of taxpayers, the claim that American homeowners, broadly, would be taxed is an overstatement.

It was drafted in response to a Huntington Beach, California, law that conflicted with state law and would require voters to show ID at polling places in 2026.      All people must provide proof of identity when they register to vote in California. Falsifying voter registration information is a felony punishable by up to three years in prison.","Voter ID remains a contentious topic in U.S. elections, and a new California bill related to the practice has become the target of misinformation.

The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We also saw a Facebook  post  that said the bill would ""ban voter ID statewide."" These claims are misleading and lack context about California’s current voter ID laws. Senate Bill 1174  prohibits local governments from requiring voter ID at polling places, but existing state law already says that, in  most cases , California voters needn’t show ID before voting at the polls. The Legislature passed the bill in August, and it awaits Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval.  The bill was drafted in response to  Huntington Beach, California , passing a measure  that would supersede California state law and require voters to present their ID at the city’s polls. By state law, however, California voters need to show ID to polling place workers only if they are voting for the first time after registering to vote by mail and did not provide a valid form of ID on their registration form, a California secretary of state spokesperson said in an email.  S.B. 1174 would  block  Huntington Beach’s voter ID requirement, which is to take effect in 2026. ""If enacted into law, SB 1774 will reduce potential voter confusion that could result from having local election procedures in place that conflict with state law,"" said Kim Alexander, president of the voting rights nonprofit California Voter Foundation.  Voter ID is  hotly debated  in U.S. politics.  Opponents say  tighter laws make voting less accessible, especially for minorities, young people, low-income voters and people with disabilities.  Proponents  of tighter rules say requiring voter ID can prevent fraud. Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections; Congress banned noncitizen voting in 1996. Noncitizens rarely cast ballots. Those who do face stiff penalties including deportation.  In April, California officials  sued  Huntington Beach, saying its new voter ID policy conflicts with state law and would create barriers for low-income, nonwhite, young, elderly and disabled voters. State Sen. Dave Min, D-Calif., who authored S.B. 1774,  said  April 2 that California ""already has robust identification procedures to register to vote."" All people who register to vote in California must sign a notice, under penalty of perjury, that states they are U.S. citizens, a California secretary of state spokesperson said. Voter registrations are then verified with the Department of Motor Vehicles’ driver's license databases and Social Security Administration information. Applicants whose information is not verified must show their IDs at the polls the first time they vote.  Providing false voter information is a  felony  punishable by up to three years in prison. Voter fraud does occur in California elections, but is rare. For example, there were eight documented cases of voter fraud in California in the 2020 election, according to  data  from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.  The majority of California voters do not vote in person. Eighty-nine percent of voters in the 2024 presidential primary election voted by mail and  federal law  mandates that all first-time voters must show ID when requesting mail ballots.  An Instagram post said S.B. 1174 would eliminate voter ID requirements at polling places in California. A similar one on Faceook said it would ""ban voter ID statewide."" S.B. 1174 prohibits local governments from requiring voter ID at polling places, but existing state law already says that in most cases, California voters don’t need to show ID before voting at the polls. The bill was drafted in response to a Huntington Beach bill that conflicts with state law and requires voters to show ID at polling places in 2026.  All California voters must validate their identities through a multistep process when registering to vote. Falsifying voter registration information is a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. There have been instances of voter fraud in California elections, but they are rare. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

politifact,Vice President Kamala Harris “is a communist. … She is really a Marxist.”,"Marxism refers to the school of thought inspired by Karl Marx’s analysis of capitalism. Communism is a political system of government or a party that abolishes private property.  	  Communism and Marxism experts said Vice President Kamala Harris’ positions do not align with those philosophies. Harris is not against private home or business ownership, for example.  	  Her campaign pledge to pass a federal ban on price gouging on food drew criticism, but experts said it does not amount to communism.","Former President Donald Trump frequently derides Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Comrade Kamala."" He says she must be stopped to prevent the United States from turning communist or Marxist. ""She is a communist, I guess,"" Trump said in an  Aug. 26 podcast with host Shawn Ryan , a former U.S. Navy SEAL who has  praised Trump . ""I look at action, I don’t look at words,"" Trump said. ""She is really a Marxist. Her father is a Marxist professor. … This country is not ready for a Marxist or a communist.""  Trump made similar statements in other speeches. In  La Crosse, Wisconsin,  he said, ""She is in fact a Marxist-slash-communist."" In Michigan, he said Harris ""is a Marxist, just like her father"" and  also called her a ""fascist."" Ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Trump  posted  a  fake   image  showing a red-clad female leader resembling Harris addressing a red-flag waving crowd while a communist hammer and sickle flag hung overhead. Weeks later, Elon Musk, the X owner and entrepreneur who backs Trump, posted another  fake image  of Harris wearing red communist military garb.  These attacks echo those of 1950s McCarthyism, when Sen. Joe McCarthy, R-Wis., led hearings on what he alleged was communist infiltration in high levels of the federal government.  Marxism refers to the school of thought inspired by Karl Marx’s analysis of capitalism. Communism is a political system of government or a party that abolishes private property.  The attack line in 2024 could resonate with some Latino voters, including in Florida, whose families fled authoritarian regimes such as Cuba where the government seized their land and stifled dissent.  We have rated similar attacks against  congressional Democrats ,  Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla .,  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt ., and  Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio , as False or Pants on Fire. The case against Harris is similarly wrong. Her policies do not amount to communism or Marxism, political science experts said. ""Nearly all examples of communism in power came about through a violent revolution against the existing order and resulted in the abolition of private property, state takeover of the economy, one party, undemocratic rule, the crushing of dissent, and the loss of civil liberties and civil society institutions like a free press,"" Baruch College sociology and anthropology professor Ted Henken said. Asked for evidence to support Trump’s claim that Harris is communist, the Trump campaign singled out her position on price controls. ""Kamala Harris has literally suggested price controls as a matter of economic policy,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Caroline Sunshine told PolitiFact. ""Would encourage you to inspect the well documented list of Marxist and communists who've suggested the same."" In an  Aug. 16 speech in Raleigh, North Carolina , Harris said, ""I will work to pass the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food."" That would require buy-in from Congress. Harris called for ""new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules"" and said she favors more support for smaller food companies. But Harris has been  vague about the details . In  social posts  and  campaign website materials , Trump refers to Harris’ plan as ""Soviet-style price controls."" The Trump campaign pointed to a column written by  Washington Post  opinion writer Catherine Rampell, headlined: ""When your opponent calls you ‘communist,’ maybe don’t propose price controls?"" (Rampell has also  criticized Trump’s economic ideas. ) We sent the Trump campaign’s evidence to academics with expertise in Marxism or communism, including those with expertise in Latin America or the former Soviet Union. We noted examples we found of Harris showing support for people  owning their own homes  or  businesses  — basically the opposite of calling for government takeovers. No expert called her a communist or Marxist.  Harris supports conventional welfare state capitalism, in which the government regulates the market while respecting private property and economic rights, Henken said.  ""Her positions on health care, the reigning in of price gouging, and assistance to home buyers and small businesses all presuppose the existence of a robust capitalist market-driven economy,"" Henken said. ""They only seek to make the availability of certain capitalist goods more fair and affordable. In a communist system, such goods would be controlled and provided by the government, not owned or controlled privately."" Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute and anthropology professor at Florida International University, said ""a communist or Marxist person is someone who supports the state ownership of the means of production, usually controlled by a single political party."" But Harris hasn’t expressed such a position, Duany said. ""Nor has her political platform endorsed anything akin to the economic and political system in Cuba since 1959,"" he said. When we asked Harris’ campaign about Trump’s claims, spokesperson Ammar Moussa said, ""She is a capitalist."" Harris’ interest in tackling price gouging, which her critics see as interfering in the free market, has precedent — but mostly among Republicans. President Richard Nixon  announced in 1971  ""a freeze on all prices and wages throughout the United States.""  When Harris was a senator from California running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, she took some stances favored by the left wing of her party. Harris then backed the  Green New Deal , a blueprint for environmental policy changes, and  Medicare for All , which would have established a national health insurance program administered by the federal government (private insurers could continue to operate, but only to offer supplemental coverage). She has pursued neither policy as vice president and has not touted them on the 2024 campaign trail — and even if she had, that doesn’t mean she is a communist. ""The positions she has taken on some issues are left-wing, but hardly communist,"" said Harvey Klehr, retired Emory University historian who has written books about communism.  Anna Grzymala-Busse, a Stanford University political science professor and expert on post-communist politics, told us by email that Harris’ positions don’t make her a communist or Marxist. ""Both of the mainstream American political parties are to the right of the most conservative mainstream parties in Europe, where *right-wing* parties support national health care systems, subsidized university educations, public housing, and far greater taxation,""  Grzymala-Busse said. Communist regimes had planned economies in which all prices and quantities were set by the government.  ""Price controls may be misguided, but they are *not* communist,"" Grzymala-Busse said. ""Price controls can distort free markets: Communism does away with them. There is simply no comparison."" Harris’ father, Donald Harris, is a retired  Stanford University economics professor . In a  July 25 profile , The Economist magazine said Donald Harris’ work ""is more unashamedly Marxist than anything in modern American politics."" The magazine said his 1978 book, ""Capital Accumulation and Income Distribution,"" focused on economic inequality, growth and the downside of profit-seeking capitalist economies. Some other news outlets, including  Fox News , said the Stanford Daily newspaper in 1974 called Harris a ""Marxist."" (The New Yorker magazine wrote that Donald Harris is  estranged  from his daughter.) We contacted the elder Harris at his Stanford email address and received no reply. But even if calling him a Marxist were reasonable, it does not mean that his daughter holds identical views. Trump said Harris ""is a communist. … She is really a Marxist."" Four experts we interviewed answered unanimously: She is neither. The Trump campaign pointed to Harris’ plan to ban price gouging by applying price controls. That proposal — which is short on details — has been criticized as ill-advised, including by some liberals. But its scope falls far short of communist policy, which advocates a political system of government or a party that abolishes private property. Harris has not called for seizing private homes or businesses. Harris’ campaign describes Harris’ stance as capitalist, not Marxist, and experts say her policies are based on the assumption of a market-driven economy. Her issue portfolio consists of mainstream left-of-center views, and would be uncontroversial even among right-of-center parties in Europe. When Trump calls Harris a communist, it evokes fear in Americans who fled authoritarian communist regimes. Neither her past nor current positions reveal Harris, the U.S. vice president for the last four years, to be communist.   We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

politifact,"A zero-tolerance policy during the Trump administration ""led to less family separation than under Kamala Harris' border policies.”","The Trump administration had a 2018 policy that led to the separation of more than 5,500 children from their parents by immigration officials at the border when they crossed into the U.S. illegally.      The Biden-Harris administration rescinded that policy.     The Trump campaign pointed to data about children who came to the U.S. alone without a parent or guardian. Those children were not separated from their parents by U.S. border officials.","Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, defended former President Donald Trump’s immigration record during an appearance on NBC and pointed instead at the Biden-Harris administration’s record. NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker asked Vance whether families would be separated under a mass deportation program if Trump were reelected. Vance said, ""You start with the most violent criminals in our country,"" and then claimed Harris' policies have led to thousands of migrant children living with sex traffickers and drug cartels instead of their families. ""There was a zero-tolerance policy during the Trump administration, and that led to less family separation than under Kamala Harris' border policies,"" Vance said  Aug. 25 . ""That's what's so striking about this. Actually enforcing our border is the most humane thing, for children and certainly for American citizens."" ""Family separation"" and ""child separation"" are not legal terms. They have generally been used to refer to the Trump administration practice of having immigration officials systematically separate children from their parents at the U.S. border to deter illegal border crossings.  When contacted for evidence to support Vance’s statement, the Trump campaign pointed us to  data  and  information  about children who crossed the border alone during the Biden-Harris administration.  These examples are not equivalent. The Trump administration zero-tolerance policy meant that U.S. immigration officials separated children and parents who arrived at the border together. The children the Trump campaign is referring to did not come with parents or other relatives.  Children separated from their parents are ""a completely different situation,"" said Peter Margulies, an immigration law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. Unaccompanied children have ""nothing to do with kids who arrive with their parents. It's like apples and oranges."" Typically, a child and adult who arrive together at the U.S. border can be separated when: Border officials cannot establish the custodial relationship. Officials believe the custodian may threaten the child. The custodian is being detained for prosecution. Immigration experts told us  in 2019 that family separations were rare during the Obama administration and preceding administrations and did not happen at the same scale as under the Trump administration. The controversial family separations during Trump’s tenure happened because of an April 2018 policy introduced by Trump’s then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions said an ""escalated effort"" was necessary at the southwest border and directed the application of the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, to prosecute all adults illegally entering the United States.  That meant that the Trump administration  referred for prosecution  all adult immigrants who illegally entered the country, even if they arrived with their children. When border officials referred parents for prosecution, their children were taken from them and placed in U.S. Health and Human Services Department custody.  Amid growing criticism of family separations in  public opinion surveys  and by  some Republicans , Trump issued a  June 2018  executive order to detain families together when they arrived at the border if the parents faced prosecution. The  executive order  said the administration’s policy would be to ""maintain family unity."" The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the zero-tolerance policy. In December 2023, as part of a settlement, a  federal judge prohibited the separation of families  at the border for deterrence.  Lee Gelernt, lead ACLU counsel, told PolitiFact that more than 5,500 children were separated from their parents at the border during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden  rescinded the Trump era policy  and issued a February 2021  executive order  to establish a task force to reunite separated children and their families. The ACLU told us in August that up to 1,000 children have not yet been reunited with their parents.  To support Vance’s claim, the Trump campaign pointed us to  monthly data about unaccompanied children  border officials encountered during the Biden administration, including more than 6,000 encounters in July.  The Trump campaign also pointed to an Aug. 19 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General  report  about unaccompanied minors released from federal government custody. The report led  Republican lawmakers  and conservative news outlets to say that Immigration and Customs Enforcement "" lost "" the children or that they are "" missing .""  But the report does not mention children ""separated"" from their families at the border. The inspector general found that Immigration and Customs Enforcement transferred more than 448,000 unaccompanied children to Health and Human Services’ custody from fiscal years 2019 to 2023 (which includes about two years of Trump’s administration). The inspector general report said ICE reported there were more than 32,000 unaccompanied minors who did not appear for their immigration court hearings during this period and that children ""who do not appear for court are considered at higher risk for trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor."" But immigration experts told us that the Trump-Vance campaign is conflating unaccompanied minors with children separated at the border. The inspector general’s report ""is entirely about unaccompanied children, which by definition means they arrived at the border unaccompanied by a parent or other legal guardian,"" Theo Liebmann, a Hofstra University law professor who has represented immigrants, said. ""So it is not possible for the report to be speaking to any ‘separation’ of children from their parents by border personnel."" Immigration experts said the Trump policy was one of a kind.  ""To our knowledge, zero tolerance is the only policy that affirmatively resulted in the separation of children from their parents,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan organization focused on immigration.  When parents in other countries send their children to cross the U.S. border alone, they are choosing to separate themselves in their home country. That’s different from family separation by U.S. border enforcement. ""The former is a problem of U.S. law generally, while the latter was a problem caused by Trump administration policies, such as prosecuting adult border crossers and placing their children with other adults,"" Margulies said. Policymakers from both political parties argue that federal laws that provide legal rights for unaccompanied children encourage parents to permit their children to travel alone to the U.S.  Poverty, violence and climate change have led some children to leave their home countries in search of jobs in the U.S.  ""But that's family separation ‘at the source,’ not at the border,"" Margulies said. Vance said, ""There was a zero-tolerance policy during the Trump administration, and that led to less family separation than under Kamala Harris' border policies."" The terms ""family separation"" or ""child separation"" have generally described the Trump administration practice of having immigration officials separate children from their parents at the U.S. border to deter illegal crossings. Immigration experts said Trump’s policy was an outlier in recent decades among Republican and Democratic administrations. The policy caused the separation of 5,500 children from their parents at the U.S. border, according to the ACLU.  The Trump-Vance campaign did not point to a Biden-Harris policy that lets border officials separate children from their families. The campaign referred us to data about children who arrived in the U.S. alone.  But these examples are not equivalent. Unaccompanied children arrive at the border without a parent — a choice they or their families make before proceeding to the U.S. alone. We rate this statement False.

But now some social media users are doing it for him — they say McDonald’s itself denied her employment story. ""MCDONALD’s CORPORATE has come forth and said they have no record whatsoever of KAMALA HARRIS ever working at any of their locations,"" an X post screenshot shared Aug. 31 on  Facebook said.

(Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) (Screengrab from Facebook) But these posts are wrong: McDonald’s has issued no such statement. Harris has mentioned her job at McDonald’s on the campaign trail and in other public appearances. Her campaign told PolitiFact that Harris worked the cash register and staffed the fry and ice cream machines at a McDonald’s in Alameda, California, in summer 1983. Harris attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., from 1982 to 1986. We searched McDonald’s Corp.’s website and social media accounts and found no public statements from the company about Harris’ work experience there. We also found no news coverage of such a statement from the company. PolitiFact contacted McDonald’s about this claim but did not receive a response before publication. When we asked Trump’s campaign for evidence, spokesperson Anna Kelly told PolitiFact, ""Kamala Harris said that she paid her way through college by working at McDonald's. Why won’t she prove it?"" Trump’s campaign also pointed to an Aug. 29  article  from the conservative Washington Free Beacon that said Harris did not mention her McDonald’s job in her books or on a 1987 resume. The article did not cite evidence disproving Harris’ work experience there. Harris has not talked extensively about her job at McDonald’s when she was a college student, but since the 2024 presidential campaign started, the mentions have become more frequent. The earliest instance PolitiFact could find of Harris talking about her McDonald’s job is from 2019, when Harris  marched  with striking McDonald’s workers in Las Vegas. At the time, Harris was a Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election. ""I worked in McDonald’s. I was a student when I was working in McDonald’s. There was not a family relying on me to pay the rent, put food on the table and keep the bills paid by the end of the month,"" Harris  said  in 2019. In April, before Harris launched her 2024 presidential campaign, she  talked  about working at the fast food chain on ""The Drew Barrymore Show."" Harris said she ""did fries"" and worked as a cashier. She said her go-to order is a ""quarter-pounder with cheese and fries"" and her favorite dipping sauce for McNuggets is barbecue. Since launching her 2024 presidential campaign in July, Harris has highlighted her summer job at McDonald’s in  campaign   ads  and on  her   personal   and   campaign  X accounts. A pro-Harris political group also touted her McDonald’s job in an  ad . ""Determination is how Kamala Harris went from working in McDonald’s to prosecutor, state attorney general, U.S. senator and our vice president in only one generation,"" one of her ads said. Harris’ running mate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also pointed on the campaign trail to Harris’ McDonald’s job. At the Aug. 13 American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Convention in Los Angeles, Walz  talked  about Harris’ middle-class upbringing and how she ""picked up shifts at that McDonald’s as a student.""

politifact,Project 2025 would defund K-12 schools.,"Project 2025, the 900-page conservative presidential transition document sponsored by the Heritage Foundation think tank, calls for eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, which would phase out some, if not all, federal aid to public K-12 schools. The project proposes transitioning some programs to the states over 10 years and cancels others it deems ineffective. Former President Donald Trump also supports abolishing the department.     The federal government provided about 14% of public K-12 funding in fiscal year 2022, with most of the money going to programs to support disadvantaged, low-income students and students with disabilities.     Although the majority of public schools receive most of their funds from state and local sources, education policy experts said that some states and districts that receive a greater share of federal aid would experience steep losses from the proposal.","Vice President Kamala Harris’ new campaign attack ad shuffles through the pages of Project 2025, calling it the ""922-page blueprint to make Donald Trump the most powerful president ever."" Former President Trump and his campaign have distanced themselves from the conservative presidential transition plan but Democrats continue to link him to it, highlighting Trump’s past ties to  many of its contributors . The narrator in Harris’ ad  ""Control""  repeats some claims about the document that we have covered before, such as ""requiring the government to monitor women’s pregnancies"" (it  requires states  to report abortions and miscarriages) and imposing ""severe cuts to Medicare and Social Security."" (Project 2025 calls for changes to Medicare, but  does not  support Social Security cuts.) The narrator says the manual calls for ""eliminating the Department of Education and defunding K-12 schools."" We  have covered  how Project 2025 dismantles the U.S. Department of Education as part of a push to have more ""limited"" federal involvement in school policy. Trump  supports  that move. For this fact-check, we wanted to know how Project 2025 would affect federal funding for public schools. Losing federal dollars wouldn’t zero out budgets for most districts.  Public schools, with some exceptions, receive the majority of their funding from local and state governments. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government provided around 8% to 10% of K-12 school funding. COVID-19 relief funding pushed the share to about 14% in 2022, but it has expired. But the federal contribution still translates into billions of dollars, and states and school districts that receive a higher share of those dollars would feel a disproportionate hit. The Harris campaign pointed PolitiFact to Department of Education K-12 spending data.  In fiscal year 2023 , the agency received $79.6 billion for K-12 funding; the money was earmarked primarily for programs to support special education and education for disadvantaged, low-income students, among other initiatives. The department’s  2023 budget  — $274 billion — includes a large chunk for student loans and college aid, which includes income-based aid such as Pell Grants. In an emailed statement, Project 2025 told PolitiFact the fact that school budgets rely on federal money for only a small share of their funding means cutting the department ""hardly defunds schools."" The project proposes transitioning some programs to the states over 10 years and cancels others it deems ineffective. In a  video about his education policy,  Trump promised to shutter the department and ""to send all education work and needs back to the states."" He did not say how federal dollars would be redirected. His Republican National Convention  platform  also calls to cut federal funding ""for any school pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content."" Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said his administration will improve ""academic excellence for all students from all educational backgrounds"" by ""increasing access to school choice, empowering parents to have a voice in their child's education and supporting good schools and teachers."" Project 2025 calls for dismantling the Department of Education and transferring its  Title I program , which helps fund schools with large populations of K-12 students from low-income families, to the Department of Health and Human Services. The plan aims to provide the funding in a block grant, giving states more flexibility on how to spend the money by being less prescriptive. The proposal phases out Title I over 10 years, shifting the funding responsibility to the states.  The plan recommends a similar move for the department’s Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funding, converting the special education money that now goes to schools into HHS-run block grants for states to distribute to parents. What would happen next is hard to say, because state education spending varies widely. ""Some states might fund their own programs to help students in ways that are similar to what the federal programs do today,"" Holly Kurtz, director at EdWeek Research Center, and Sterling Lloyd, the center’s assistant director, told PolitiFact in a joint email. ""Other states could choose to go in a different direction with their spending."" Presidents could not do this on their own. Abolishing the department would require an act of Congress and bipartisan support, which has proved a long shot. ""Congress is one that decides the federal education budget, and the funding that’s in there is pretty popular on both sides of the aisle,"" said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University’s Edunomics Lab. ""States can always say no thank you to federal funds and rules, and so far none have. Not one."" Trump made a  similar campaign pledge  to reduce the Education Department in 2016, but curtailed his plans once in office. His first budget for the 2018 fiscal year proposed cutting the department's budget by 13%, rather than calling for its elimination. Trump proposed similar spending cuts in his next two budgets; none were approved. The majority of K-12 public school funding money comes from state and local governments through a mix of state income taxes, state sales taxes and local property taxes. The amount of federal money flowing to schools varies across states and school districts. For example, Arkansas' federal share is 20%, South Dakota's is 21% and Mississippi’s is 23%. New York's is 7% and Massachusetts’ is 9%.  Districts that serve more students from low-income families and students with disabilities would feel the brunt of federal funding cuts more severely than districts that serve fewer of those students. The hit could be substantial in large school districts such as Detroit, which has a 48% federal share, and Oklahoma City, where the share is 34%. Beyond providing some funding to schools, the Education Department also houses the National Center for Education Statistics, the nationwide data source on schools, and its Office for Civil Rights, which investigates thousands of allegations of discrimination and harassment in schools annually.  Project 2025 would direct other agencies to absorb those responsibilities. It would move the school assessments and other research functions to the U.S. Census Bureau and have the Justice Department’s Office for Civil Rights absorb the Education Department’s office. Critics say these groups are already significantly underfunded. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights gets ""thousands of civil rights complaints each year that deal with allegations of race, sex and disability-based discrimination in schools across the country,"" said Robert Kim, executive director at the Education Law Center, a legal advocacy organization for public education. ""The office has been really underfunded for decades now and the work has exponentially increased."" Does cutting the federal share amount of ""defunding"" schools, as Harris’ ad says? The word can mean anything from cutting funds for schools to gutting it completely. Merriam-Webster’s  definition of the word  — ""to withdraw funding from"" — fits for Project 2025’s proposal. ""If the viewer of the advertisement interprets ‘defund’ to mean that schools would receive no more money, period, under Project 2025, then that is false,"" Kurtz and Sterling said. ""However, if the viewer interprets ‘defund’ to mean a reduction in funding to K12 schools, then the advertisement is true because Project 2025 does include initiatives that would reduce funding for K12 schools."" Sean Corcoran, a Vanderbilt University public policy and education professor, said shuttering the department ""would go far to defund a lot of schools."" Frederick Hess, senior fellow and education policy studies director at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Project 2025 would ""absolutely not"" defund schools. ""Just for starters, 90% of K-12 educational funding is state and local,"" Hess said. ""Would Trump or Project 2025 marginally trim the rate of increase in public school spending? Possibly. (Project 2025) would block grant Title I (about 2% of school spending) and then theoretically keep reducing it over a decade."" A Harris campaign ad said Project 2025 would defund K-12 schools. Eliminating the Department of Education would phase out some, if not all, federal funding for public K-12 schools and return that responsibility to the states. The federal government provided about 14% of K-12 funding in fiscal year 2022 with added COVID-19 funding that has expired. Most money goes to programs to support disadvantaged, low-income students and students with disabilities. The majority of schools receive most of their funds from state and local sources, education policy experts noted that some states and districts receive a greater share of federal aid and could face greater losses from the proposal.

They're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there.”","A Springfield, Ohio, city spokesperson, the mayor and city police all said claims that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating residents’ pets are unfounded.     The claims appear to have originated with unverified social media posts.     Read a roundup of our  fact-checks from the first presidential debate  between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.","Former President Donald Trump at his Sept. 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris repeated a debunked claim that Haitian immigrants were eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. ""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" Trump said as he attacked Harris and President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. Karen Graves, a Springfield spokesperson,  told PolitiFact  there are ""no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community."" Springfield police told a  local news outlet  the agency knew of no such reports about pets.  The claim has gone viral in recent days, spread in part by high-profile conservatives, including  Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio . X owner  Elon Musk , Sen.  Ted Cruz , R-Texas, the Republican-led  House Judiciary Committee  and conservative influencer  Charlie Kirk  shared claims similar to Trump’s on social media.  Some of the social media claims mentioned immigrants killing ducks or geese, but Graves said there were no reports of that or other crimes that have recently been pinned on Haitian immigrants.  Vance defended Trump’s claim in the spin room after the debate. He pointed reporters to a Sept. 10  article  from conservative website The Federalist that included an Aug. 26 police report and audio recording from a caller to a communications center in Clark County, Ohio, where Springfield is. The caller reported a group of four Haitian people in Springfield, each carrying a goose.  ""Whether they were eating geese or dogs, is that really what we’re going to hang our hat on?"" Vance said, The Washington Post  reported . However, the city spokesperson said there were no reports to the city of ducks or geese being killed or other crimes that have recently been pinned on Haitian immigrants.  Springfield Mayor Rob Rue at a Sept. 10  city commission meeting  reiterated that there were no credible or specific claims about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets. ""Rumors like these are taking away from the real issues such as housing concerns, resources needed for our schools and our overwhelmed health care system,"" Rue said. Many of the social media posts that shared the claims  relied on an account  from an unidentified person shared in a private Facebook group that said its author’s neighbor’s daughter’s friend came home from work to find her cat butchered and hanging in a tree at a Haitian immigrant’s home next door.  Trump campaign spokespeople did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Trump’s debate claim. Vance, in a  follow-up X post  Sept. 10, said his ""office has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants."" Vance appeared to acknowledge that some reports may not be accurate, writing, ""It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false."" But he also said in another  follow-up post : ""Keep the cat memes flowing."" The influx of as many as 20,000 Haitian migrants in the community has sparked controversy, particularly in August 2023, after a Haitian immigrant without a valid Ohio driver’s license drove a minivan into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy, The New York Times  reported . Since 2023, some Haitians have come to the U.S. through the Department of Homeland Security’s  humanitarian parole program  that lets people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and their immediate family members request to come to the United States legally. They can be paroled into the United States for up to two years. The Haitian immigrants using that program are in the U.S. legally, a  Springfield city website  notes. The language about Haitian immigrants eating family pets is similar to  unfounded claims  some conservatives shared earlier this year warning about gangs of Haitian cannibals that may be coming to the U.S. Experts told PolitiFact such narratives painting Haiti as a barbarous country are not new, and are racist attempts to dehumanize Haitians. Trump said that in Springfield, Ohio, Haitian immigrants are ""eating the pets of the people that live there."" He doubled down on the claim after being corrected by debate moderator David Muir, despite multiple news outlets debunking the claim a day earlier and against the backdrop of rebuttals from Springfield city officials. The claim appears to stem from an unverified secondhand Facebook post. A city spokesperson and Springfield police said they have received no credible reports that pets are being abducted and eaten by the immigrants. Springfield’s mayor also said the claims are not credible at a Sept. 10 city commission meeting.

It does not show them discussing how to illegally register homeless voters, elections officials there said.     Homeless voters can list a street corner, a park or wherever they normally reside as their place of residence. They must also provide a mailing address, for example, a shelter, a post office box, a relative’s home or a nonprofit group’s address where they can receive mail.","A video of a Dallas County Elections Department training class in Texas is being falsely shared online as evidence of voter fraud. A  Sept. 9 X post  with a grammatical and a spelling error said, ""Dallas County Texas Tell Election Workers To ILLEGALY LIE ON REGISTRATION & USE A CHURCH ADDRESS TO REGISTER HOMELESS PEOPLE TO VOTE!"" The post was written by John Basham, who the Dallas Morning News  reported  is a former Reno, Texas, city council member. The ""Video Was Recorded August 24th During Election Training By Dallas County Elections Dept.,"" Basham wrote, linking to  an X post  with the same video from conservative media personality Joe Hoft.  Basham’s post had more than 60,000 likes and 2.7 million views by Sept. 11, according to X. We contacted Basham through an X message but received no response. We found other social media posts sharing the  same   video  and  language  used in Basham’s post.  In the 34-second video Basham shared, a woman seated in a classroom setting asked, ""So we should just put the church address because that’s where they come?"" Someone off camera responded: ""Where do they sleep?"" the person asked. ""On the street,"" the woman responded. ""They sleep right outside the church."" ""That’s the residence address,""  the person off camera said. ""If they sleep in that area, give a description, that’s the residence address. You have to … include a mailing address. If the church has a box that she’s going to share with them, the box is fine. That’s the mailing address."" What the people described is perfectly legal under Texas law. The Dallas County Elections Department released a  Sept. 10 statement  in response to what it called ""misinformation"" in the social media posts. ""These claims falsely imply that legally protected voter registration practices are acts of voter fraud,"" the statement said. ""State law is very clear: having a home is not a requirement to be eligible to register to vote, and voters can use an address other than their residential address as a mailing address."" Dallas County Elections Administrator Heider Garcia said voting eligibility requirements are clearly defined in state law. ""Our unhoused population in Dallas County, many of whom are veterans, deserve to be treated like every other voter who is allowed to use an alternate mailing address,"" Garcia said in the statement. The state law that Garcia referred to, which was also cited in a community note on Basham’s post, says in  Sec. 13.002 of the election code  that a voter application must include the applicant’s residence address, ""or, if the residence has no address, the address at which the applicant receives mail and a concise description of the location of the applicant ’s residence."" ""The law is crystal clear on this, a person does not lose their right to vote when they experience homelessness,"" said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of  Common Cause Texas, a voting rights advocacy group. ""Texas law explicitly allows a person experiencing homelessness to use an alternate mailing address."" TexasLawHelp.org, an effort by Texas legal aid organizations and foundations, courts, and nonprofits to provide free, reliable legal information to low-income Texans,  described on its website  how unhoused people can register to vote in the state. Such voters ""can include the address where you sleep most often as the place you ‘reside.’ this can be a shelter address, a park address, or even a street corner."" Homeless voters must also provide a valid mailing address. That can be a post office box, or some shelters and nonprofit organizations may allow them to use their addresses to receive mail, the website said. Texas’ law regarding homeless voters is in line with other states, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, a national advocacy group for the homeless. A  webpage  for the group’s ""You Don’t Need a Home to Vote"" campaign said, ""Many individuals, homeless or otherwise, aren’t even aware that no state requires residents to have a traditional residence in order to vote in elections."" A separate  webpage  specific to Texas said homeless voters must provide an address where they can receive mail, such as a shelter, service provider or relative, but a residential address can be wherever they usually reside, such as a park or street corner. An X post said that Dallas County election workers were telling trainees to illegally lie on voter applications and use a church address to register voters. The Dallas County Election Department called this claim misinformation. It said state law is clear that you don’t need a home to vote, and that voters can use an address other than their residential address as a mailing address. Texas law supports this and is consistent with laws across the country, homeless advocates say. This video didn’t show election workers advising breaking the law; it showed them following it.

politifact,"“As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, for the first time this century.”","A Defense Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that the U.S. is not currently engaged in a war, nor does the U.S. military have service members fighting in any active war zones.     However, some U.S. military service members are stationed in areas the U.S. government recognizes as combat zones.      In 2024 alone, several U.S. service members have been killed or injured during military operations abroad.","The  first 2024 presidential election debate  between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump touched on many issues, including U.S. military activity abroad. ABC News moderators asked Harris whether she believed she bore any responsibility for the way the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021. Thirteen U.S. service members  were killed  in an attack during the withdrawal. Harris said she agreed with President Joe Biden’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. ""Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,"" Harris  said . ""And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, first time this century."" When we contacted Harris’ presidential campaign for evidence to support this statement, a spokesperson referred us to the Defense Department. A Defense Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that the U.S. is neither engaged in a war, nor has service members fighting in active war zones anywhere in the world. ""An aspect of military service includes serving in locations where hostile actions may occur,"" the Defense Department official said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""Those locations are designated by executive order and/or the Secretary of Defense. However, it’s important to note that just because a service member is in one of these locations does not mean they are engaged in war."" But Harris’ inclusion of ""combat zone"" in that statement is misleading and experts said it significantly underplays the broader landscape of active duty military service abroad. The Internal Revenue Service tracks combat zones for tax purposes. The term generally refers to ""hostile areas where (the) military may serve, (including) actual combat areas, direct combat support areas and qualified hazardous duty areas,"" the IRS  said  on a webpage last reviewed and updated Aug. 19. Citing the Defense Department, the IRS  said  that as of August, recognized combat zones included the Sinai Peninsula, and the Afghanistan, Kosovo and Arabian Peninsula areas. Melanie Sisson, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, a think tank, said some of these combat zone designations, such as the one over Kosovo, are ""holdovers"" from previous U.S. military operations. But the combat zones do include areas in which U.S. service members are now deployed, she said. PolitiFact asked the Defense Department for a list of places within the designated combat zones that U.S. military service members are serving in, but we did not receive a response before publication. As of June, the nonpartisan think tank Council on Foreign Relations  said  the U.S. had several thousand service members stationed across multiple foreign countries and on ships at sea in the Middle East. Many of these countries are in the currently recognized combat zones listed on the  IRS website . Specifically, the Defense Department and news outlets have reported that there are about  2,500 U.S. service members in Iraq  and about  900 in Syria , fighting against Islamic State militants. Additionally, thousands of U.S. service members have been  deployed  to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war started in October 2023. There have been multiple instances this year in which U.S. service members have been killed or injured while serving abroad. In January,  three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers  were killed and at least 34 others were injured in a drone strike in Jordan. In February,  two U.S. Navy SEALs  drowned during an Iranian weapons seizure mission. In August,  eight U.S. service members  were wounded in a drone attack in Syria. That same month, another  seven U.S. service members  were injured in a raid targeting Islamic State militants. ""It is not accurate to suggest that U.S. service members are not, today, in harm’s way,"" Sisson said. Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor who specializes in civil-military relations, echoed Sisson, saying many U.S. military personnel are engaged in operations ""that put them at serious risk of attack by adversaries."" ""For the men and women serving on these and many other missions, not to mention their families and loved ones, this feels very much like serving in a combat zone,"" Feaver said. Harris said, ""As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, for the first time this century."" The Defense Department confirmed the U.S. military is not engaged in a war. But Harris’ statement ignores critical facts. There are thousands of U.S. military service members stationed in areas that are considered combat zones. These members face hostilities from foreign adversaries and some have been killed or injured during military operations. We rate Harris’ statement Mostly False.

(Lea más sobre  nuestra colaboración con Meta , propietaria de Facebook e Instagram). Pero la declaración de que Harris uso pendientes con audífonos es errónea. Los pendientes NOVA H1 y los que Harris llevaba durante el debate pueden parecer similares debido a que ambos diseños tienen una perla, pero al examinarlos más de cerca, se nota que tienen diferencias importantes. Los zarcillos de audio NOVA H1 fueron introducidos por la compañía como l os primeros en tener audífonos inalámbricos . A diferencia de los audífonos tradicionales, los zarcillos audífonos se colocan en el lóbulo de la oreja, no dentro de la oreja, y utilizan "" tecnología de sonido direccional "" para llevar el audio al oído, dijo la compañía.   La página web del producto muestra  dos versiones , una en plata y una en oro. Ambas versiones tienen una perla y un tallo grueso que se ajusta alrededor del lóbulo de la oreja. Malte Iversen, CEO de Icebach Sound Solutions, la compañía que produjo los zarcillos NOVA H1, le dijo a PolitiFact en un correo electrónico juguetón ""nosotros no sabemos"" si Harris usó uno de los productos de su compañía. La  página  de Icebach Sound Solutions dice que una ""edición especial para los debates presidenciales"" va a estar disponible pronto; Iversen le dijo a PolitiFact que el producto se agotó. La página web también dice que dada la atención que recibieron después del debate, la compañía dará una entrevista a Jimmy Fallon, el presentador del The Tonight Show, para ""aclarar los rumores y mitos alrededor de su maravilloso producto"".  No hay evidencia de que Harris usó los aretes NOVA H1. Harris llevaba aretes con dos líneas más finas — como un imperdible doblado por la mitad, con la perla como cabeza. La candidata presidencial demócrata, la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, habla durante un debate presidencial con el candidato presidencial republicano, el expresidente Donald Trump, en el Centro Nacional de la Constitución en Filadelfia, el 10 de septiembre de 2024. (AP) La declaración también se hizo viral en  X  en inglés, donde una nota comunitaria dijo que los pendientes de Harris eran de Tiffany & Co. La nota citó el blog fundado por Susan E. Kelley, ""What Kamala Wore"", que dice que Harris usa  un par de pendientes de perlas de los mares del Sur  de la  colección Tiffany HardWear  ""con cierta frecuencia"". El blog también dice que ya no están disponibles en la página web de Tiffany & Co. Kelley  dijo en su blog  que Harris usó los pendientes de Tiffany durante el debate presidencial.

Davis correctly pointed out that killing a baby after it is born is illegal in all 50 states.","ABC News debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis have received  criticism  from former President  Donald Trump  and other conservatives for fact-checking Trump several times during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. One social media user criticized Davis’ fact-checking Trump on abortion, but put words in her mouth. ""Last night during the ABC debate, two of the participants, otherwise known as the moderators of the debate, made the false claim to Donald Trump that there is nowhere in the United States where abortion is legal up until birth,"" a man said in a  Sept. 11 Instagram video . ""Unfortunately for ABC, this is their own graphic which clearly shows if you read right here, the states in dark green have no restrictions based on gestational age,"" the speaker said.  The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) The video showed a June 2023 ABC News graphic that has since been  updated to include three additional states  that have no restrictions based on gestational age. But ABC’s fact-check of Trump on abortion was not about state restrictions on gestational age. The Instagram post criticizes a fact-check that Davis didn’t make, a  transcript  and video of the exchange shows. The exchange began when Davis asked Trump why women voters should trust him about reproductive rights policy when he has changed his position on abortion. Most recently, Davis noted, Trump said he supports Florida’s six-week abortion ban, which he previously said was too brief. Trump responded by falsely accusing Democrats and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, of supporting postbirth abortions. ""Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby. ""And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is OK. And that's not OK with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states."" Trump mistakenly referred to West Virginia’s governor, when he meant Virginia’s Democratic former governor, Ralph Northam. Trump has repeatedly  misstated  Northam’s 2019 comments about abortion to claim Northam approves of executing babies. And  The Washington Post found  that Harris’ running mate Gov. Tim Walz has made no such statements about abortion or ""execution after birth."" Trump went on for a few more moments in the debate, then Davis concisely fact-checked Trump’s claim about post-birth abortions. ""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said, before turning to Harris for a response. As PolitiFact has  reported   before , willfully killing a newborn child is infanticide and illegal in all 50 states. Fetal deaths in the third trimester are exceedingly rare and usually involve emergencies such as fatal anomalies or life-threatening complications affecting the mother, health experts have said. For fetuses with very short life expectancies, doctors may induce labor and offer palliative care to make the newborn as comfortable as possible.  Neither moderator fact-checked Trump again on abortion for the rest of the debate. An Instagram post claiming a moderator falsely told Trump ""that there is nowhere in the United States where abortion is legal up until birth"" misstates what Davis said. She corrected Trump’s false claim that Democrats support ""executing"" babies after birth, which is illegal.

The suspect has been arrested and charged with two federal gun crimes.","Soon after U.S. Secret Service agents intervened to stop a  second assassination attempt  against former President Donald Trump on Sept. 15, social media users started spreading conspiracy theories about the incident, including that it was staged. Some users pointed to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign sending fundraising emails hours after the incident as proof. ""Trump is fundraising from these shooting incidents, it's almost like these are staged,"" an X user  posted  Sept. 15. Another X user tagged Trump’s X account and  wrote , ""I don't buy your story for a second. So vague, with so little detail trickling out, like you're making it up as you go. No footage, no real details. Yet somehow, you had fundraising emails ready to go in minutes? Feels completely staged."" Other users  on X  and  Instagram  made similar claims. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) These claims are baseless. The FBI  said  it is investigating the event as ""what appears to be an assassination attempt"" against Trump. As Trump golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, a man  pointed a gun  through the fence and bushes at Trump, who was 400 to 500 yards away. Per safety protocols, a U.S. Secret Service agent was stationed one to two holes ahead of Trump. At about 1:30 p.m., the agent ahead of Trump noticed the rifle barrel pointed through the fence and fired at the gunman, who drove away from the scene. Authorities later apprehended the suspect, whom they  identified  as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58. Trump’s campaign  posted  on X about an hour after the incident, saying Trump was ""safe following gunshots in his vicinity."" Trump himself  posted  on Truth Social that night thanking the Secret Service and local law enforcement for ""the incredible job done today."" Court documents said authorities recovered an AK-47-style rifle equipped with a scope, two bags, a digital camera and a black plastic bag containing food from the spot Routh had positioned himself along the fence surrounding Trump’s golf course. Officials  shared   photos  of the evidence with news outlets during the press conference. Court filings show Routh was charged with two federal crimes: possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Claims that  violent incidents  and shootings were ""staged"" to distract from other news are a  common  trope among misinformers. In July, when a gunman opened fire on Trump during a Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally and a bullet grazed Trump’s ear, social media users also falsely claimed that assassination attempt was  staged . Social media users claimed the apparent assassination attempt against Trump on Sept. 15 was ""staged."" There is no evidence to support this. The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential assassination attempt against the former president. Authorities recovered evidence, including a rifle, after the event, and the suspect has been charged with federal gun crimes. This claim is inaccurate and meritless.

politifact,"“In Project 2025, you’re going to have to register with a new federal agency when you get pregnant.”","Project 2025 recommends that states submit more detailed abortion reporting to the federal government. It calls for more information about how and when abortions took place, as well as other statistics for miscarriages and stillbirths.     The manual does not mention, nor call for, a new federal agency tasked with registering pregnant women.","Democrats are growing bolder in their warnings about Project 2025.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said Sept. 14 the project would require women to register with the federal government when they become pregnant. ""By the way, Project 2025. Some of you want to know, in there, they've got a national pregnancy coordinator that tracks all pregnancies,"" Walz  told the crowd in Superior, Wisconsin.   ""Think about what they're saying in Project 2025, you're going to have to register with a new federal agency when you get pregnant,"" he added. Walz’s claim is a new version of something Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have been saying  for   weeks : that the 900-page presidential transition document calls for monitoring each woman’s pregnancy.  It doesn’t. Walz is describing a policy that doesn’t exist.  Project 2025 spokesperson Ellen Keenan told PolitiFact the claim was ""completely false and ridiculous."" The Harris-Walz campaign did not offer comment for this fact-check. Project 2025  is a conservative presidential transition document filled with policy recommendations for the next Republican administration. It was developed by the Heritage Foundation think tank, with contributions from dozens of other conservative organizations and  at least 140 people  who worked in the Trump administration. The manual proposes stronger state-based abortion data as part of its broader push to refashion the Health and Human Services Department into a ""Department of Life."" But it’s far short of what Walz described.  Project 2025 would withhold federal money from states that don’t report abortion data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The document  calls for the Health and Human Services Department to ""use every available tool, including the cutting of funds,"" to ensure states reporting the following: The number of abortions within their borders. The weeks of gestation the abortion took place. The reason for the abortion. The pregnant woman’s state of residence. The method of the abortion. It says these statistics should be separated by category, including spontaneous miscarriage, treatments that incidentally result in fetal death (such as chemotherapy), stillbirths and induced abortion.   States  are not required  to submit abortion data to the  CDC , but the majority do, except for California, Maryland and New Hampshire. To collect individual state data, most state vital statistics agencies have designed a form that abortion providers use for reporting.  The Project 2025 document does not call for a new federal agency for pregnancy registration. Women would not need to notify the state or federal government when they become pregnant.  Walz’s description of a ""national pregnancy coordinator"" appears to twist another Project 2025 proposal that would refocus the mission of an office in the  U.S. Agency for International Development .  Project 2025 proposes renaming the agency’s Office of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment as the Office of Women, Children and Families. It would designate the existing senior gender coordinator as the ""pro-life politically appointed Senior Coordinator of the Office of Women, Children, and Families,"" and eliminate the agency’s ""more than 180 gender advisors and points of contact.""  The office’s senior gender coordinator currently oversees gender equality policy and programming. The document does not mention adding pregnancy monitoring to the role. Former President Donald Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, which overlaps with some of his ideas but not all of them. These ideas do not appear on Trump’s agenda.  When Trump was asked in April whether states should monitor or punish women who have illegal abortions, Trump said some states ""might"" choose to do that and that it was up to them. Walz said that Project 2025 requires women to register with a new federal agency if they get pregnant. The manual does not mention, nor call for, a new federal agency to be created for pregnancy registration. The policy document recommends that states provide more detailed and consistent abortion reporting to the federal government. It calls for more information about how and when abortions took place, as well as details about other manners of fetal death, such as miscarriages and stillbirths. We rate this claim False.

politifact,"""Typically you have three to four debates in a U.S. Senate race. (Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. has) given me one debate, almost a month after early voting has started.""","Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. and her U.S. Senate race opponent, Republican Eric Hovde have agreed to one debate on Oct. 18. In her past campaigns, Baldwin has agreed to three debates, and two or three are typical in Senate races.     In-person absentee voting, commonly known as early voting, can’t begin in Wisconsin until Oct. 22.      But voters who request absentee ballots through the mail could fill them out and return them before the debate.      Oct. 18 is in the typical time frame for debates in Wisconsin U.S. Senate races.","Many eyes were recently on the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, but there’s another debate coming up in Wisconsin. That’s the one between Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican challenger Eric Hovde, scheduled for Oct. 18. It will be  hosted  by WMTV in Madison and aired throughout Wisconsin. After the debate was announced, Hovde  pushed  Baldwin to participate in two more debates that he’s agreed to, in Milwaukee and Green Bay. And now, he’s arguing the debate happens after voting starts.  ""Typically you have three to four debates in a U.S. Senate race. She's given me one debate, almost a month after early voting has started,"" Hovde  said  in a NewsNation interview on Sept. 3, 2024. Let’s tackle this claim in two parts.  First, has Baldwin agreed to fewer debates than normal for a U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin? And second, does the debate take place almost a month after early voting has started in Wisconsin? PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted the Hovde campaign for backup, and spokesman Ben Voelkel cited examples of debates from past U.S. Senate cycles in Wisconsin. The most recent Senate race was in 2022, between Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes.  Johnson agreed to  up to three debates , and Barnes accepted two. Those  took place  Oct. 7 and Oct. 13, so slightly earlier than the Baldwin-Hovde debate but in the same time frame. In 2018, when Baldwin faced Republican opponent Leah Vukmir, there were  three debates : Oct. 8, Oct. 13 and Oct. 19.  In 2016, Johnson and Democratic challenger Russ Feingold participated in  two debates : Oct. 14 and Oct. 18. In 2012, during Baldwin’s first run for Senate against former Gov. Tommy Thompson, there were  three debates : Sept. 28, Oct. 18 and Oct. 26. So, in that race, a much wider time range than other cycles. It looks as if between two and three debates is normal in recent Senate races in Wisconsin. Hovde is on the mark when he says three is typical, but four goes a little too far.  PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted Baldwin’s campaign for a response, and they cited only the two debates in the 2022 Johnson-Barnes race. They also noted there was only  one debate  between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican challenger Tim Michels in 2022. That debate took place on Oct. 14.  Baldwin campaign spokesman Andrew Mamo sent a statement similar to one  earlier this year , noting Baldwin ""travels the state constantly"" to meet Wisconsinites and the debate ""will air in every region of the state."" So, it doesn’t look as if more debates between Baldwin and Hovde will be added.  Now, let’s consider the second part of Hovde’s claim: Does the Oct. 18 debate take place ""almost a month"" after early voting starts in Wisconsin? Early voting is  another name  for in-person absentee voting, which  can take place  in Wisconsin from Oct. 22 through Nov. 3. Early voting involves going to your clerk’s office or another designated location and casting an absentee ballot in-person, before the election.  It’s up to each city, village or town to decide how many dates, times and locations to offer early voting.    Early voting cannot start more than two weeks before the election, according to the  Wisconsin Elections Commission . That date in 2024 — Oct. 22 — is after the Oct. 18 debate, and definitely not almost a month before the debate.  But the full picture is a little more complicated. There’s still a way for voters to cast their ballots — voting absentee by mail — before the Oct. 18 debate.  Hovde’s campaign cited the deadline to send out absentee ballots in federal elections. The  state deadline is even earlier , Sept. 19, and clerks are told to mail absentee ballots as soon as they’re available.  Clerks must send absentee ballots to voters with active requests by that deadline, and voters will  start receiving them soon after .  Certainly some voters will receive ballots by the Oct. 18 debate, though whether voters will get them in the mail a month before the debate is hard to predict.  Voters could choose to fill out their ballot and return it immediately. But ""spoiling"" ballots — essentially taking your ballot back and voting a different way — is  no longer allowed  in Wisconsin.  So, if a voter submits their ballot then changes their mind after the Baldwin-Hovde debate, there’s no reversing that vote.  And again, the Oct. 18 debate doesn’t take place later than normal in Wisconsin — that falls in the same time frame as past election cycles. Hovde said, ""Typically, you have three to four debates in a U.S. Senate race. (But Baldwin has) given me one debate, almost a month after early voting has started."" Baldwin agreed to three debates in her previous campaigns for Senate, though some recent statewide races have had two. Hovde is on par with three, but saying there’s typically four debates is a stretch.  The debate does not start before in-person absentee voting in Wisconsin, also known as early voting. But some voters could still receive, complete and return absentee ballots before the debate, so that portion of his claim does have merit.  Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",mostly-true,Eric Hovde,2024-09-03,2024-09-17,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/TAMMY_BALDWIN/7321beb48cf6bc2102f9d220749d350e.JPG,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/17/eric-hovde/does-the-baldwin-hovde-debate-take-place-after-vot/,"Elections, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Eric Hovde"

ABC News moderator Linsey Davis rebutted Trump’s statement,  saying , ""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born."" The day after the debate, some social media posts said the moderator was wrong. In a Sept. 11  Facebook post , Tony Perkins, president of the anti-abortion Family Research Council, wrote, ""In 12 states, children born alive after a failed abortion have no legal protection, and in three more states children born alive after an abortion had legal rights that governors — like Tim Walz — repealed."" The post linked to the Family Research Council’s  website  and included a U.S. map color-coded according to what the activist organization describes as the states’ ""born alive protections."" (Screengrab from Facebook) Perkins said in the post that this lack of protections means babies are ""being left to die or gruesomely killed after being born alive following a failed abortion."" The Family Research Council also  posted  a similar claim on its Instagram account. These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Infanticide, the crime of killing a child within a year of its birth, is illegal in all states, and every person who is born has legal protections under federal and state laws. The  Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 , which both chambers of Congress passed and then-President George W. Bush signed, established that federal legal protections that applied to ""persons"" also covered children born at any stage of development, including after an abortion. But homicide laws in every state already make it illegal to kill a baby, regardless of whether the baby was just born or is a few months old, said Priscilla Smith, director of the Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice at Yale University’s Law School. The vast majority  of abortions in the U.S., more than 90%, occur in the first trimester, or before 13 weeks. About 1% take place after 21 weeks, and far less than 1% occur in the third trimester. Experts said cases in which babies are born following an abortion attempt are rare. The Family Research Council’s  website  argues the 2002 federal law does not ""include any legal enforcement."" So, the organization advocates for additional requirements for health care providers, such as the ones included in the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act , legislation that has been introduced and reintroduced in Congress for years. Democrats have  largely opposed  the bills, saying current law renders them redundant. The legislation would require health care practitioners to give the same care to ""infants born alive after an abortion or attempted abortion"" as ""any other child born alive at the same gestational age"" and ""ensure the child is immediately admitted to a hospital."" Providers who fail to do so would face criminal prosecution, as would anyone who ""intentionally kills or attempts to kill a child born alive."" The Family Research Council  says  its map of ""born alive protections by state"" shows which states have adopted some of the proposed federal legislation’s provisions. The organization labeled states without these provisions as having ""no protection."" And states, such as  Minnesota in 2023  under Walz, that have repealed any of the provisions were labeled as ""removed protection."" Mary Szoch, director of the Family Research Council’s Center for Human Dignity, said in a statement to PolitiFact, ""If federal law was sufficient to protect these babies, why would 35 states, including several pro-abortion ones, have laws protecting babies born alive following abortions?"" But legal experts dispute the idea that the federal law, and by extension some states, lack legal protections for babies ""born alive.""  The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act amended the federal definition of a person so that ""any federal prohibition on any form of violence, including homicide, would be extended to an infant born alive after abortion,"" said Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis law professor and abortion historian. David Cohen, a Drexel University law professor who specializes in the intersection of constitutional law and gender, said once born, ""you have all the protections of every criminal law, every civil law, including laws against murder, including laws against assault, including medical malpractice laws, etc."" In May 2023, the Minnesota Legislature passed and Walz  signed  an update to a state law for ""infants who are born alive."" Previously, state law said, ""All reasonable measures consistent with good medical practice, including the compilation of appropriate medical records, shall be taken by the responsible medical personnel to preserve the life and health of the born alive infant."" The law was updated to instead say medical personnel must ""care for the infant who is born alive."" The law’s updated version, however, kept the provision that said, ""An infant who is born alive shall be fully recognized as a human person, and accorded immediate protection under the law."" Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Minnesota, told PolitiFact that Perkins’ claim misconstrues the Minnesota law passed under Walz’s governorship. What the update did, Hermer said, was remove parts of the previous version of the law ""that made it sound as if multiple infants were being born alive following attempted abortions."" ""Post-viability abortions are very uncommon in Minnesota, as elsewhere, though they do occasionally occur. Abortions resulting in live births, while hypothetically possible, are vanishingly rare,"" Hermer said, citing  data  from the Minnesota Department of Health. Democratic Minnesota state Sen. Erin Maye Quade said in some cases when there are  lethal fetal anomalies  that make it likely the fetus will die before or soon after birth, parents decide to terminate the pregnancy by inducing childbirth. ""In those circumstances, the children, the babies that are born are meant to be alive because their parents want to hold them before they die. That is not a failed abortion. Childbirth was the method of abortion in that circumstance,"" Maye Quade said. The previous version of Minnesota’s law was ""requiring these unnecessary and harmful medical interventions for infants that were going to die,"" Maye Quade said. ""And because of that, parents weren't often able to decide to deliver their children alive."" This update to the law means infants who are ""born alive"" receive appropriate medical care dependent on the pregnancy’s circumstances, Maye Quade said. In January 2023, Walz also  signed  into law a measure codifying abortion access protections. Perkins said, ""In 12 states, children born alive after a failed abortion have no legal protection, and in three more states children born alive after an abortion had legal rights that governors — like Tim Walz — repealed."" Legal experts said this is wrong. Every person who is born has protections under federal and state laws. It’s illegal in every state to kill a baby after it’s born.

Esta muestra una imagen de Harris a la izquierda y de Swift a la derecha cabizbaja y como si se estuviera limpiandose lágrimas.  La publicación fue marcada como parte del esfuerzo de Meta para combatir las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma. (Lea más sobre  nuestra colaboración con Meta , propietaria de Facebook e Instagram). PolitiFact contactó al publicista de Swift, pero no recibimos una respuesta.  Swift  publicó  en su Instagram el 10 de septiembre que ella votará por Harris y su compañero de fórmula Tim Walz, el gobernador de Minnesota.  Pero PolitiFact no encontró  noticias verídicas  en la base de datos Nexis o  declaraciones   públicas  de Swift diciendo que perdió millones de dólares en acuerdos con marcas por apoyar a Harris.  Al hacer una búsqueda en Google del titular de la publicación traducido al  inglés , encontramos un artículo publicado el 12 de septiembre con una imagen de Harris y Swift en  Esspots , una página web que se describe como creadora de contenido satírico. El artículo también tiene una etiqueta que dice ""sátira"".  Al leer el  artículo  este dice que Swift respaldó una criptomoneda vegana respaldada por el primo segundo de Elon Musk, el propietario de X, y que las marcas por eso cancelaron sus contratos con ella. Algo que no es real y que el mismo artículo admite ""es SÁTIRA, No real"". El grupo de criptomoneda, FTX, de Sam Bankman-Fried, llegó a las últimas etapas de la negociación de un acuerdo de patrocinio por un valor de más de $100 millones con Swift, pero las conversaciones fracasaron meses antes del colapso de la bolsa en noviembre 2022,  según  The Financial Times.  Esspots menciona acuerdos de Swift con  CoverGirl  y  Coca-Cola  como los acuerdos afectados. Pero PolitiFact  encontró  que aunque Swift tuvo un acuerdo con Diet Coke en  2013 , no se han reportado nuevos acuerdos en los años recientes. No sabemos si el acuerdo con CoverGirl del 2010 sigue vigente, pero tampoco encontramos  comunicados de prensa  o publicaciones en las  redes   sociales  de  la empresa de cosméticos, que pertenece a la empresa  Coty , que digan que  terminó alguna relación con Swift debido al respaldo a Harris. Un enlace en los comentarios de la publicación en Facebook lleva a una página llamada  Luxury Blog , la cual ha publicado información que PolitiFact ha calificado como  Falsa . Notamos que la página web no tiene una sección que explica quienes son, no existen biografías de sus autores al darle click a sus nombres y su sección de categorías tiene palabras con errores ortográficos y no concuerdan con los artículos dentro de ellas. Al leer el  artículo  de la supuesta pérdida de millones de Swift, este no cita ninguna fuente verídica o nombra a una marca que haya cancelado contratos con la cantante. Esta tampoco dice que el contenido es sátira.  También notamos que la cuenta en Facebook que publicó la declaración sobre Swift, "" Breaking News Today "", ha publicado falsedades. Por ejemplo,  dijo  que ABC News despidió al presentador David Muir por verificar lo que dijeron Harris y el expresidente Donald Trump en el debate presidencial el 10 de septiembre, algo que calificamos como  Ridículo y Falso . Muir sigue reportando noticias para ABC News. No hay reportes verídicos diciendo que Swift perdió $125 millones en acuerdos con marcas por apoyar a Harris. Esa declaración se originó en una página satírica.

politifact,"“If you make less than $100,000, Trump is about to raise your taxes. Currently, you’re taxed at 10% and then 12%. He would raise that to a flat rate of 15%.”","The tax plan that would raise taxes for people who make less than $100,000 is from Project 2025, a conservative presidential transition plan, not from Trump himself.      Many former Trump administration officials contributed to Project 2025, and its proposals do have some overlap with the former president’s platform. Because of this, Democrats have sought to frame it as a plan from Trump, and say his distancing himself from it should not be taken seriously.      But in this instance, Trump has not proposed or said he endorses the tax plan that Project 2025 lays out, meaning there’s no currently available evidence that he would pursue it if re-elected.     Trump has said he would extend the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If he does, people making less than $100,000 would not see their income taxes increase to 15%.","Money and the economy has had a starring role in the runup to the 2024 presidential election.  Both former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, have argued that their economic plan would put more money in Americans’ pockets and that their opponent’s plan would do the opposite.  Regardless of party, it resonates with voters, including in purple Wisconsin:  the most recent Marquette University Law School poll  showed that the largest percentage of registered voters surveyed — 41% — rated the economy as a top issue.  As always, taxes are a part of that discussion. The Wisco Project, a liberal group focused on turning out college-aged voters in Wisconsin, is taking on Trump’s tax plans  in ads running on Snapchat.   ""If you make less than $100,000, Trump is about to raise your taxes,"" the ad says. ""Currently, you’re taxed at 10% and then 12%. He would raise that to a flat rate of 15%.""  Is Trump planning to raise taxes for people making less than $100,000 if re-elected? Let’s take a look.  When asked for evidence to support the group’s claim, a Wisco Project spokesperson pointed to Project 2025, a presidential transition plan created by several conservative policy organizations and led by the Heritage Foundation.  Trump has attempted to distance himself from the document, and Harris has sought to tie him to it. Some of Trump’s past administration officials are involved in the project, and  there is some overlap between Trump’s platform and Project 2025’s proposals , but he has no direct involvement and it is not a campaign policy proposal.  USA TODAY has rated False a claim that the document is a plan from Trump.  So, how are people who make less than $100,000 currently taxed, and how would the proposals under Project 2025 change that? For the current tax year under the  2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , income up to $11,600 is taxed at 10%, and income from $11,601 to $47,150 is taxed at 12%. Income from $47,151 to $100,525 is taxed at 22%.  Project 2025 calls for creating just two income tax brackets: One at 15% and one at 30%, and eliminating most deductions, credits and exclusions. The program says the 30% tax rate should start ""at or near the Social Security wage base,"" which is around $168,600.  Although the Project 2025 plan doesn’t specifically recommend eliminating the standard deduction, if it were done away with along with most other tax credits, then people making up to $100,000 would end up paying a higher effective tax rate on their whole income, while people on the higher end of the first bracket would be paying lower taxes.  But that’s under a tax plan Trump has neither proposed nor endorsed. Trump has made statements and taken policy positions on taxes that are different from Project 2025’s proposals. He says he would  extend the provisions  of the 2017 tax law, which are set to expire in 2025. The  2024 Republican Party platform  calls for making the 2017 tax law permanent. The platform also calls for removing taxes on tips and Social Security income.  If Trump is elected and he successfully keeps the existing tax brackets in place, people making less than $100,000 will not see their income taxes increase to 15%, because the tax brackets will remain the same as they are today. Trump has  regularly repeated false claims  during his presidential run, making it difficult for some to take him at his word. The Wisco Project pointed this out in its statement, writing, ""We believe his record of spreading constant lies and mis-information on a near daily basis gives him no credibility for the public to believe his denials regarding Project 2025.""  Still, Trump has never said that he plans to enact the tax policy changes that Project 2025 proposes, so there’s no currently available evidence that he would pursue it.  The Wisco Project ad claimed that for Americans making less than $100,000, ""Trump is about to raise your taxes"" to a flat rate of 15%.  This idea comes from Project 2025, a conservative presidential transition plan that Democrats have sought to tie to Trump.  But right now, there’s no concrete evidence that Trump supports this specific tax plan.  We rate this claim False.   ",false,Wisco Project,2024-09-16,2024-09-20,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP_20274674709129/322cfa007f890ad7be92629f42b2ac4f.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/20/wisco-project/trump-has-not-said-hell-raise-taxes-on-people-maki/,"Elections, Taxes, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Wisco Project"

politifact,"In Springfield, Ohio, “murders are up by 81%.”","The campaign cited data showing from 2021 to 2023, murders in Springfield, Ohio, rose from five to nine. That’s an 80% increase.      A crime data expert cautioned against making annual comparisons in places where less than one homicide is reported each month, noting that homicides would be considered too rare to draw conclusions.      FBI homicide data also showed that the number of homicides in Springfield fluctuated without a clear trend from 2012 to 2022.","As he repeated  unsubstantiated claims  about Haitian immigrants, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, linked the recent immigration uptick in Springfield — an Ohio city with about 58,000 people as of the  2020 census  — to rising murders.  ""The local services are completely overwhelmed,"" Vance  said  Sept. 15 on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" adding that people in Springfield have struggled to afford housing. ""Homelessness has gone up. Murders are up by 81% because of what Kamala Harris has allowed to happen to this small community.""  Vance, former President Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, was one of the first conservative politicians to elevate the falsehoods that  Haitian migrants have eaten pets . Local and state leaders have rebutted such claims and said  the rumors distract  from genuine housing, schooling and health care constraints the city has faced as its immigrant population increased. One thing they haven’t talked about is rising murder. In fact, the city’s immigration  FAQ webpage said  Haitian migrants are more likely to be the victims of crimes than perpetrators, citing Clark County jail data. A Trump-Vance campaign spokesperson pointed us to  data showing  that from 2021 to 2023, murders in Springfield rose from five to nine. That’s how Vance gets an 80% increase.  Case closed? No.  Looking further back, the number of homicides in Springfield fluctuated without a clear trend from 2013 to 2022. In 2018, for example, when there were fewer migrants and Trump was president, there were 13 homicides. A criminal justice expert cautioned against relying on annual changes in Springfield to draw conclusions about crime.  ""With less than one homicide per month, statistical tests on annual changes are not possible. Homicides are too much of a rare event to determine whether small changes are statistically meaningful,"" said John Roman, director of the  Center on Public Safety and Justice  at the nonpartisan research group NORC at the University of Chicago.  Springfield has attracted Haitian migrants because of its relatively low cost of living and the job opportunities that city leadership and its chamber of commerce created, according to  news   reports .  Haitian migrants began moving to Springfield  around 2017 , and the number increased around 2020 and 2021,  The Guardian ,  The New York Times  and  NPR  reported. The city of Springfield’s  website  estimates there are about 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants in Clark County, Ohio, where Springfield is located. Of that total, about 10,000 to 12,000 are Haitian,  according to Chris Cook , health commissioner for the Clark County Combined Health District.  Vance has not demonstrated how Haitians are connected to murders, which have fluctuated over the last decade. Clark County Prosecutor Daniel Driscoll, a Republican,  told CNN  that he’d seen no murders where Haitians were perpetrators or victims in his 21 years in office. Vance’s murder statistic comes from the  Ohio Incident Based Reporting System , a state-run program for Ohio law enforcement agencies to voluntarily submit crime data. Springfield police started reporting its figures in 2021.  We wanted a longer view, so we looked up homicide data  reported  by the Springfield police department to the FBI over a 10-year period, starting in 2013. The latest data available is for 2022. (The FBI defines ""homicide"" as ""the killing of one human being by another,"" which differs slightly from the first dataset’s  definition  of ""murder"" for a killing that was ""willful."") The number of homicides reached a decade-high of 13 homicides in 2018. In 2019, it dropped to a low of two. In 2020, there were eight homicides. In February 2021, then-Springfield Police Chief Lee Graf  told the Springfield News-Sun  that homicides in Springfield are often premeditated or crimes of passion with personal motives and rarely involve a random victim. The Springfield police department did not reply to PolitiFact’s query for information about murder data. Local news outlets in Springfield reported data that’s different from what the Ohio reporting system shows, and counts vary among outlets. For example, the Springfield News-Sun  reported  that there were nine homicides in 2021;  WHIO-TV said  there were 12 homicides in 2021.  The Springfield News-Sun reported  at least nine homicides  in 2023, as of Nov. 29. Based on that figure, Springfield had no change from 2021 to 2023. Vance said, ""Murders are up by 81%"" in Springfield.  Data reported to the Ohio Incident Based Reporting System showed that from 2021 to 2023, murders in Springfield rose from five to nine — an 80% increase.  Longer-term data, from 2013 to 2022, reported by the Springfield police to the FBI, shows that the number of homicides has fluctuated in Springfield without a clear trend. Data reported by a local news outlet also doesn’t show a change in homicides from 2021 to 2023. Vance offered a cherry-picked statistic as he and Trump criticized the effects of immigration into Springfield. But the city said Haitian migrants are likelier to be the victims of crimes than the perpetrators. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.

JD Vance have spread the false and  ridiculous   claim  that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, local leaders have reiterated that the community is grappling with real immigration-related issues that need attention, including housing, health care and public education. Trump tried to describe some of those issues during a  Sept. 18 rally in Uniondale, New York .  But in his telling, the community’s leaders have taken extreme measures to assist Haitian children in public schools, including hiring a private interpreter for every student. ""So, the mayor of Springfield, and I think he's a very nice person,"" Trump said about  48 minutes  into his speech. ""But instead of saying, ‘We're getting them all out, we're getting them out,’ he says very simply, ‘We're hiring teachers to teach them English.’ Could you believe it? We are hiring interpreters. So, when they go to school and take the place of our children in school, we have an interpreter. Each one will have a private interpreter."" Springfield schools have hired staff to teach Haitian students and other English language learners, but we found no evidence that each student ""will have a private interpreter."" We also found no evidence that non-Haitian students have been displaced.  Here’s what we know. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said in September that the city added  12,000 to 15,000 immigrants  in the past four years. Most immigrants in Springfield are Haitian, but not all. In July, City Manager Bryan Heck cited a higher number of  15,000 to 20,000  Haitians arriving in Springfield over the last four years in a community of just under 60,000. Many migrants were  fleeing years of political unrest  and  seeking jobs in the city’s growing labor market  and are  in Ohio legally . Springfield City Schools Superintendent Robert Hill said federal and state funding have not generated enough resources for local schools to meet the needs of the growing immigrant community, however. ""When you jump from 200 to approximately 1,200 in two years it puts a strain on the system but, as everyone is aware, we are legally required to educate every student who walks through our doors and we’ve done so and done so successfully and will continue to do so with the resources we have,"" Hill said during a Sept. 17  press conference. Hill said the district had hired many teachers qualified to teach English as a second language while also forming university partnerships to help fill the need. He did not mention having interpreters for every Haitian student.  Asked for evidence behind Trump’s claim, a Republican National Committee spokesperson pointed PolitiFact to news reports about a rise in the city’s Haitian student population. Dayton CBS affiliate  WHIO-TV  reported in August that the district had 1,600 non-English speaking students, up from 250 in 2017. The district said there were 18 English as a Second Language teachers and that it hired bilingual assistants to translate documents and communications with parents. The TV report said that students speak Haitian, French, Portuguese and Spanish. ""Everything that we’re doing now, we are having to make sure that we look at it through that lens of, how can we also serve not only our English-speaking students but our non-English students and families,"" Pam Shay, Springfield City School District director of federal programs, told the TV station. The New York Times  reported in September that ""nearly 350 new students registered for elementary and middle school the first week of classes, most of them children of immigrants."" The Times wrote that ""the school district has hired about two dozen teachers who are certified to teach English as a second language and several Haitian-Creole interpreters, thanks to federal and state pandemic-related funds.""  NPR  reported that the mayor said the local school system, on average, receives 40 new students every week, many of whom don't speak English. None of those reports said that every child has or will have a private interpreter, nor did they say that non-Haitian students were blocked or removed from schools. We contacted several school officials, including the district spokespeople, and asked about the number of Haitian students and interpreters but got no response. (The district has faced unprecedented attention,  including bomb threats , in September following the false allegations about pet eating.) Figures posted on the district’s website, however, say that about 15% of its  7,700 students  are English language learners. The numbers Hill cited in the Sept. 17 press conference  matched numbers from June  school board meeting minutes  that showed that two years earlier, the district served approximately 250 English language learners. By the end of the 2023-24 school year, that had risen to about 1,200 students. Another 1,500 students were classified as nonnative English speakers, the minutes said. Springfield’s population surge has created challenges for the city, health care system, housing and schools, Gov. Mike DeWine wrote in a Sept. 20  New York Times op-ed . ""There is a desperate need for more Haitian Creole translators,"" wrote DeWine, a Republican and Trump-Vance supporter.  DeWine debunked the pet eating claims and said Trump and Vance ""continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield."" The  Springfield News-Sun  reported in September 2023 that the number of non-English speaking students, including hundreds of Haitian immigrants, in the schools had more than quadrupled over four years, prompting the district to add more multilingual resources and curriculum.  The News-Sun wrote ""although Springfield schools devote quite a bit of resources and efforts to help ELL students, Shay said it doesn't take away from the English language students."" Shay said: ""You would think that, but fortunately with various grants and funding sources that are geared towards these populations, it's not taking away from funding that's used for the English-speaking population."" (Shay referred PolitiFact to the district communication’s staff.) A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Texas case,  Plyer v. Doe,  protects the rights of children to attend public school regardless of their immigration status.  Trump has referred to the Haitians as illegal immigrants, but they are legally in the U.S. under  Temporary Protected Status , which has existed in federal law for decades. Obama announced the designation for Hatians in 2010 following a magnitude 7  earthquake  there. Trump extended the status in 2017. In 2023, the Biden administration  started  a humanitarian parole program that allows  eligible Haitians  to live and work in the U.S. for two years. In June, Biden  extended and expanded  Haiti’s Temporary Protected Status.  Trump’s use of the phrase ""take the place of our children"" aligns with the  Great Replacement Theory ,  white supremacist rhetoric  warning of an elaborate conspiracy by Western elites to systematically replace white people of European descent with nonwhite people through immigration and interracial marriage. ""It might not be an explicit reference to far-right anti-Semitic replacement theories but it is definitely a hostile way of framing immigration — legal immigration at that — as an attempt to push out, ignore, and replace natural-born white Americans with foreign people of color,"" said Casey Ryan Kelly, a communication studies professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Trump said when Haitians go to school in Springfield they ""take the place of our children in school"" and ""each one will have a private interpreter."" The Republican National Committee pointed to news articles showing that the numbers of non-English speaking students, including Haitians, have grown since 2017. The schools have hired teachers qualified to teach English as a second language along with bilingual assistants. But none of those articles showed that each student has or will have a private interpreter. Our review of school board meeting minutes and other coverage of the schools shows no plan to provide private interpreters to every student. We also found nothing showing that Haitians ""take the place"" of other school children. A school official told the Springfield News-Sun in 2023 that English language learners do not take away from the English language students.  Although Springfield schools’ resources have been strained as leaders seek to meet the needs of more nonnative speakers, Trump’s statement does not reflect the facts.

But some social media users attributed it to a more partisan and intentional motive by the office’s leader, Republican Christi Jacobsen.

The social media posts tell part of the story but leave out crucial details, misleadingly implying the glitch was intentional and affected many Montana voters. As the secretary of state’s office explained, the error affected a few overseas voters and was quickly fixed. (Instagram screenshot) Montana has an Electronic Absentee System that is limited to voters who are covered by the federal  Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act . Those voters include military service members and eligible family members and U.S. citizens living overseas, a Federal Voting Assistance Program  website said . That system lets those voters access and mark their ballots electronically. Montana’s overseas voters could begin voting in the November general election Sept. 20. But Max Himsl, a Flathead County, Montana voter living and working in the United Kingdom, noticed Harris’ name wasn’t on the ballot, the Daily Inter Lake, a Montana newspaper,  reported . Himsl reported the issue to the Flathead County Elections Department, the paper said. Jacobsen's office issued a  Sept. 23 press release  explaining what happened and countering what it said were ""egregious misinformation campaigns circulating online."" Election officials were notified about the issue shortly after the Electronic Absentee System went live at 8 a.m., the press release said. The secretary of state’s office took the system offline while the vendor that handles the system troubleshot and fixed the problem. The system was back online to voters, ""including those few voters who may have been impacted,"" by the afternoon, the release said. ""No ballots were affected, including those that will be sent to registered absentee voters and those that will be presented to voters at the polling place on Election Day,"" the office said. The secretary of state’s  website lists Harris  among the 2024 candidates for U.S. president.  K.V. ""Ginger"" Aldrich, elections administrator in Montana’s most populous county, Yellowstone, said that, to her knowledge, no Yellowstone voters were affected beyond the short delay in accessing the electronic system. ""The Secretary of State notified county election officials that they were troubleshooting missing choices in races in the electronic system for UOCAVA (Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) voters on Friday morning and were temporarily taking the system offline,"" Aldrich said. ""The system was restored later Friday by the Secretary of State. Any problems with the system would not affect paper ballots which are printed and prepared separately."" Registered overseas voters are sent physical absentee ballots in the mail 45 days before the election, but also can use the Electronic Absentee System to print a ballot and mail it back or fill in an online ballot, the secretary of state’s  website says . Bradley Seaman, Missoula County’s elections administrator, said the electronic ballots were due to be sent out Sept. 20, but, because of the error, the state told local officials about 9:45 a.m. Montana time to wait if they hadn’t yet sent them. He said the ballots for voters who choose to vote electronically come through the secretary of state’s database. The files and digital layout for the paper ballots are done through Montana’s certified vendor, Election Systems & Software. Physical absentee ballots for  Montana voters  who are not overseas will be mailed Oct. 11. Those ballots had not been printed when this error happened, Seaman said. Seaman dismissed social media claims that Harris’ name was omitted intentionally. ""It's a whole office of individuals who work collaboratively to help get this out,"" Seaman said. ""You know, I can't speak to any motives or reasons, but I feel very confident in their staff and all the people involved that this was not an intentional action.""

politifact,"“Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any other president, ever.”","Looking at the increase in federal debt, Trump currently ranks first for debt added in a single term. However, Biden is projected to pass Trump’s total by the time he leaves office in January 2025.     Using a different method — counting how much future debt was created by a president’s policies — Trump is projected to roughly double Biden’s debt amount.","Seeking to counter Republican accusations that Democrats spend too much taxpayer money, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz blamed former President Donald Trump for how much the federal debt increased on his watch. ""Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any other president, ever,"" Walz  said  Sept. 21 at a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, rally. Whether Walz is right depends on the parameters and methods analyzed. One metric shows Trump added the most debt, but also says President Joe Biden will surpass that amount. Another metric has Trump as the president contributing the most to the national debt. The most straightforward way to review Walz’s claim is by measuring how much the national debt rose on each president’s watch.  Treasury Department  data shows the gross federal debt rose by about $7.8 trillion during Trump’s presidency. To date, this is the largest increase during a single four-year presidential term. (President Barack Obama oversaw a debt increase of more than $9.5 trillion, which exceeded Trump’s one-term total, but Obama served two terms.) So far, Biden has added less to the debt — $7.6 trillion — than Trump has. But Biden still has more than three months left in his term. Counting the prorated debt that the  Congressional Budget Office  expects to be added during that time, Biden’s one-term total is on pace to reach $8.1 trillion. That would be higher than Trump’s over an equivalent time period. Although this method is straightforward, it’s also less precise, because much of the debt accumulated on any president’s watch stems from policies instituted by their predecessors. In particular, much of the current federal debt stems from mandatory payments, such as those for Social Security and Medicare. These began spiking when baby boomers started drawing heavily from these programs around 2010.  Generations of politicians in both parties approved and modified these programs long before Trump and Biden took office. An alternative method seeks to skirt this challenge. The  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a think tank that studies fiscal policy, calculated how much Trump and Biden policies would increase the debt over the succeeding 10 years. The group found that during his four years in office, Trump approved policies that created $8.4 trillion of new borrowing needs — $8.8 trillion in borrowing minus $443 billion in deficit reduction. By contrast, the group calculated that Biden enacted policies that added $4.3 trillion of new borrowing over 10 years — $6.2 trillion in new borrowing minus $1.9 trillion in deficit reduction.  Among the most costly programs Trump enacted were his tax cut legislation, which added a projected $1.9 trillion to the debt, and government spending bills for 2018 and 2019, which added a projected $2.1 trillion. Removing the legislation intended as pandemic relief from the calculation, as some  economists recommend , Trump still created more borrowing obligations than Biden did, based on the committee’s calculations. Trump’s nonpandemic total was $4.8 trillion; Biden’s was $2.2 trillion. (Because previous presidents didn’t add nearly as much debt in any four-year period, it’s safe to estimate this is also the record for one term.) Much of the debt allocated to Trump and Biden will not show up in the federal ledger until years after they leave office. Walz said, ""Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any other president, ever."" The increase in the federal debt on a president’s watch shows that Trump ranks first for debt in a single term, but Biden is projected to pass him by January 2025, when he leaves office. Using a different method — counting how much future debt a president’s actions created — Trump created about double the amount of future debt than Biden did.

We found  numerous  social media  posts  that  said  the ballot errors were intentional, with one X post calling the Walz misspelling "" election interference ."" The ballot errors were real — Montana’s overseas ballots  briefly omitted  Harris’ name and a Florida county sent ballots listing ""Tom Walz"" instead of ""Tim Walz"". But the social media posts omitted that election officials caught the errors and quickly fixed them, leaving few voters affected. There’s no evidence either incident was intentional. Qualified overseas voters, including military service members and U.S. citizens residing abroad, can receive electronic ballots for U.S. elections, thanks to the federal  Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act .  In Montana, the state’s Electronic Absentee System went live Sept. 20. One problem: Harris’ name was missing as a candidate for president. Montana’s secretary of state’s office  said  a voter reported the issue shortly after the system went live, and the system was taken offline. The system was up and running again later that day with the correct ballot. Only a few voters were impacted, and no printed ballots were affected, officials said. Florida also sent overseas electronic ballots Sept. 20. But a problem soon emerged in Palm Beach County, home of the infamous  butterfly ballots and hanging chads  from the 2000 presidential election: Walz’s first name was spelled incorrectly — as ""Tom Walz"" — on Palm Beach County’s overseas electronic ballots. But there was no foul play afoot. The mistake was the result of a typo by an election vendor that shouldn’t have been typing in names to begin with, said the county’s Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link.  Link is a former Republican appointed to the post by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2019. She  switched parties  to run for election as a Democrat in the left-leaning county in 2020, and is running for reelection in November. Link told PolitiFact that the county has one ballot file that is rigorously proofread — including by representatives for the candidates and the parties — for all ballots. But Enhanced Voting, the vendor that handles the county’s overseas ballots, chose to manually type in the vice presidential candidates’ names instead of using the file, Link said. ""The unfortunate part is we had no idea they had done that,"" Link said. ""So had we known that, we would have known, obviously, that it needed to be proofread again."" The vendor then sent overseas voters a link Sept. 20 to download the electronic ballots, which contained the error. Link said her office learned of the typo early the next morning. Link said her office determined that 257 people had opened the email with the misspelling before it was corrected. Some of those 257 people may have seen the corrected ballot by the time they downloaded it, she said. Link said an email was sent to those 257 voters notifying them of the updated link. Palm Beach County’s  overseas voters  don’t fill out an online ballot — people who request an electronic ballot must print it out and either fax or mail it back to the county.  They can also request a printed ballot be mailed. Printed ballots are not produced by the same vendor and were unaffected by the error, Link said. At least three Palm Beach County voters had returned ballots with the misspelling before it was corrected, Link said Sept. 24. There could be more if voters printed them out and the office hasn’t received them yet. Regardless, Link said, those votes will be counted as voters intended, even if they voted for ""Tom"" Walz. Any voters concerned about their ballots are welcome to call the Palm Beach County office, Link said. The error was limited to the 257 Palm Beach County ballots, Enhanced Voting President Aaron Wilson said. Enhanced Voting provides electronic ballot delivery for many Florida counties and is used in 1,500 jurisdictions in 24 states. Travis Hart, the Lafayette County supervisor of elections and president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections, said he was unaware of the error happening in any other counties. Florida Department of State's Director of External Affairs Mark Ard said Sept. 25 that his office had not received reports of errors in any other counties. ""We regret the typo that led to these ballots going out with a candidate’s name misspelled, and we are glad it was reported and addressed so quickly,"" Wilson said. ""We have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again."" Link said her team would examine what they can do when working with vendors to avoid a repeat of the error in the future. ""The important thing is that it doesn't have any effect on the tabulation of the ballots,"" Link said. ""Obviously we hate that it happened. We strive for excellence, and we know our voters expect that from us, and so we do hold ourselves accountable, whether it was our error or not."" A Threads post claimed Florida put ""Tom Walz instead of Tim Walz"" on its ballots. That did happen, but it didn’t happen statewide, as the post claimed, and it affected few voters.  An election vendor inserted a typo on an online ballot available to overseas voters. The county’s elections supervisor said 257 overseas voters opened an email that contained a link to the ballot with the typo. The link was updated the day after the ballots were sent. As of Sept. 24, three voters had returned ballots with the spelling mistake, but officials said those would be counted as those voters intended.

Claims about covered windows and election fraud date back to the 2020 election, when then President Donald Trump and his supporters falsely  pointed to it  as evidence the election was stolen.

The Detroit Free Press  reported  that challengers gathered outside the ballot-counting area and began pounding on the doors and windows. But more than 100 Republican challengers remained in the counting area and continued to observe election workers. There is no evidence that widespread voter fraud took place.  The attorney who originally shared the Florida hurricane prep photo has a history of spreading election-related misinformation.

""Project 2025 wants to get rid of NOAA, wants to get rid of the National Weather Service — the people that tell you the weather and help you prepare for hurricanes,"" said Moskowitz, a past Florida emergency management director under Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla. Moskowitz quipped about how hurricane forecasting would function under Project 2025 and a Trump administration. ""Maybe we will just do it with a Magic 8 ball or maybe with a Ouija board. Or maybe we will do hurricane cones like President Trump did, right where he just circled in another state that wasn’t in the cones,"" Moskowitz said.  Moskowitz’s swipe at Trump referred to a Sharpie-doctored map Trump displayed in 2019, when he  falsely said  all hurricane models predicted Dorian would hit Alabama. (And Moskowitz wasn’t the first to come up with that  Magic 8 ball line. ) Partisan jostling aside, what does Project 2025 say about NOAA and the National Weather Service? A Moskowitz spokesperson, Keith Nagy, said ""while Project 2025 does not call for the complete dismantling of the NOAA, it intends to undermine the agency's independence from the executive branch and eliminate many of its internal departments. Any threats toward the NOAA or NWS jeopardizes life-saving information about hurricanes, heat waves, and other extreme weather events."" A NOAA spokesperson declined to comment. Project 2025 is the conservative Heritage Foundation’s policy blueprint for a Republican administration. Trump has disavowed it, but it was written by  several former Trump administration officials . In 2022, when Trump gave a  keynote speech  at a Heritage event in Florida, he said the organization would ""lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.""  Project 2025  includes about four pages on NOAA and the National Weather Service. That part was written by  Thomas F. Gilman , who was an official in Trump’s Commerce Department. The document describes NOAA as a primary component ""of the climate change alarm industry"" and  said  it ""should be broken up and downsized.""  The National Weather Service, one of  six NOAA offices , provides weather and climate forecasts and warnings. The  National Hurricane Center  is part of the National Weather Service within NOAA. Project 2025 would not outright end the National Weather Service. It says the agency ""should focus on its data-gathering services,"" and ""should fully commercialize its forecasting operations."" It said that ""commercialization of weather technologies should be prioritized to ensure that taxpayer dollars are invested in the most cost-efficient technologies for high quality research and weather data."" Investing in commercial partners will increase competition, Project 2025 said. Project 2025 also said the National Weather Service should become a ""performance-based organization"" held accountable for achieving specific results, even if the head of the agency must ""deviate from government rules"" to achieve those results. The document said little about the National Hurricane Center. It said the administration should ""review the work of the National Hurricane Center"" and that ""data collected by the department should be presented neutrally, without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate."" We asked several experts who are familiar with the NOAA and the National Weather Service’s work about Moskowitz’s statement. They said Project 2025 doesn’t call for the National Weather Service’s termination, but limits its work. Craig Fugate served as former President Barack Obama’s administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and as then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s emergency management director. He recently served on a federal advisory committee, the Space Weather Advisory Group under NOAA. ""While Project 2025 doesn't call for the elimination of the NWS, it places restrictions on research, climate products, and potentially limiting access to the NWS forecasters and centers such as the National Hurricane Center,"" Fugate said. Private sector criticism of the National Weather Service isn’t new, Fugate said. A 2005  bill  by then-Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., Fugate said, would have eliminated the free dissemination of weather information provided by the National Weather Service. The bill drew no co-sponsors and foundered. Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, said Project 2025’s vague language made it difficult to assess whether it called for eliminating NOAA and the National Weather Service. But ""the intent is clearly to cripple public weather forecasting,"" he said. Thoman cited examples of Project 2025’s vague phrasing on the National Weather Service: ""Should focus on its data-gathering services.""  Thoman asked whether that means doing nothing but data gathering. If so, then the weather and climate models produced continuously by the National Weather Service that private companies rely on would go away, he said. 	  ""Should fully commercialize its forecasting operations.""  Thoman asked whether that means the National Weather Service should charge for forecasts or abandon weather forecasting entirely.  Although Project 2025 seems to push collaboration with the private sector, that already happens. Private entities, including TV forecasters and AccuWeather, use NOAA data, Rachel Cleetus, policy director in the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said. ( AccuWeather said  it did not support what Project 2025 recommended.) ""The reality is NOAA and the National Weather Service are already working with a lot of commercial partners so it is unclear what exactly is the intention there,"" Cleetus said. She also said dismantling NOAA could render the agency ineffective. ""The idea that it could be broken up and somehow still be able to do this essential work, it won’t be possible,"" Cleetus said. Moskowitz said, ""Project 2025 wants to get rid of NOAA"" and the National Weather Service. Project 2025 has a few pages about NOAA and the National Weather Service and some of its phrasing is vague. But it does call for major changes. It described NOAA as a primary component ""of the climate change alarm industry"" and said it ""should be broken up and downsized."" It doesn’t explicitly call for getting rid of the National Weather Service, but it says it should ""fully commercialize its forecasting operations."" We rate this statement Half True.

In large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America.

politifact,Florida’s Amendment 3 is “the monopoly amendment.”,"Large marijuana companies support Florida’s Amendment 3, which would legalize recreational marijuana if 60% of voters approve it in November. Florida election law allows companies to financially back ballot measures.     The measure says medical marijuana treatment centers, or other state licensed entities, will be able to sell recreational marijuana products without criminal or civil liability. It does not establish a monopoly, which is already prohibited by federal law.     If approved, the measure wouldn’t take effect for 60 days and the Florida Legislature would determine processes for entities to acquire licenses to sell recreational marijuana. The state could license additional medical marijuana entities, and other companies.","In November, Florida voters won't be asked to vote just for the next president of the United States — they will also decide whether the state should legalize recreational marijuana. Opponents of Florida’s Amendment 3 claim the measure to legalize cannabis would hand marijuana megacorporations a monopoly. ""Giant corporations don’t do things out of the goodness of their heart, they do things to make money,"" a narrator says in a ""Vote No on 3""  TV ad  airing statewide. ""And that’s exactly why they wrote Amendment 3. Marijuana mega corporations spent 60 million bucks putting Amendment 3 on your ballot. Why? It entrenches their monopoly, bans homegrown pot and gives special licenses to corporations."" The ad concludes: ""They wrote it. They rigged it. And they are hoping you fall for it. Amendment 3 isn’t the marijuana amendment, it’s the monopoly amendment."" Amendment 3 , sponsored by political committee Smart & Safe Florida, would allow adults ages 21 and older to ""possess, purchase, or use marijuana products and marijuana accessories for non-medical personal consumption by smoking, ingestion, or otherwise."" Trulieve, one of Florida’s largest medical marijuana companies, has contributed $93 million to the committee since 2022 — that’s the bulk of the committee’s $101 million raised so far, Sept. 24  campaign finance data  shows. Other cannabis companies, including Curaleaf, Verano and Cresco Labs, have also contributed to support the committee backing the measure.  Trulieve’s contribution is hefty, but it’s not unusual for corporations to raise and spend large sums of funds on ballot measures, election law and campaign finance experts told PolitiFact. Nor is it unusual, they said, for opponents to attack corporate interests in ballot campaigns to evoke suspicion of their motivations. ""Companies that stand to benefit from the outcome of a ballot measure can pour millions into ballot measure fights. Just because millions are being spent does not mean the ballot measure is rigged,"" said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a Stetson University law professor.  Daniel Smith, a University of Florida political science professor, said both campaigns are pulling from a familiar playbook: ""Florida is a big state and it costs lots of money to ‘lobby’ for or against a statewide measure."" The amendment itself does not eliminate marijuana market competition. If approved by at least 60% of voters, the Florida Legislature would be able to issue additional licenses to expand the list of marijuana sellers and distributors.  Vote No on 3 argues that, although the state is allowed to approve licenses for new companies, it isn’t required to do so under the amendment. This exacerbates monopolistic concerns, the group’s counsel said in a letter shared with PolitiFact, by allowing established medical marijuana distributors in Florida — which would be eligible for recreational licensure should the amendment pass — to corner the market.  The measure’s  summary  reads: ""Allows adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products and marijuana accessories for non-medical personal consumption by smoking, ingestion, or otherwise; allows Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, and other state licensed entities, to acquire, cultivate, process, manufacture, sell, and distribute such products and accessories. Applies to Florida law; does not change, or immunize violations of, federal law. Establishes possession limits for personal use. Allows consistent legislation. Defines terms. Provides effective date."" Florida has  25 licensed medical marijuana companies , referred to by law as ""medical marijuana treatment centers.""  The amendment says these centers, or other state licensed entities, including its agents and employees, will be able to sell recreational marijuana products without criminal or civil liability under Florida law.  This wouldn’t happen immediately. The measure wouldn’t take effect until six months after passage and the Florida Legislature would outline the process for entities to acquire the needed licensing.  The amendment also says the ""legislature may provide for the licensure of entities that are not Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers.""  The Legislature ""will have the authority to enact licensing accordingly,"" said Steve Vancore, spokesperson for Smart & Safe Florida, the political committee sponsoring Amendment 3. ""We do believe that (medical marijuana treatment centers) will indeed be a part of that, but not exclusively."" Vancore also referred to Merriam-Webster’s definition of ""monopoly.""  The dictionary defines it as : ""exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action; exclusive possession or control; a commodity controlled by one party."" Smart & Safe Florida sent Vote No on 3 a letter telling it to cease and desist airing the ad. Vote No on 3 attorney Michael Beato responded in a Sept. 7 letter, citing  Black’s Law Dictionary ’s definition of monopoly: a ""privilege or peculiar advantage vested in one or more persons or companies, consisting in the exclusive right (or power) to carry on a particular business or trade, manufacture a particular article, or control the sale of the whole supply of a particular commodity.""  ""Grandfathering (medical marijuana treatment centers) into the recreational-marijuana business is in and of itself special,"" Beato said, ""there is no guarantee that the Florida Legislature will allow additional licenses.""  The measure’s proponents argued the amendment doesn’t eliminate competition or bar companies from entering the market and added that there are more applicants waiting for approval by the state’s Office of Medical Marijuana Use.  ""If (DeSantis) is concerned about the limited market, he can fix that and expand it,"" Vancore said. Torres-Spelliscy, of Stetson University, said the more accurate word is ""oligopoly,"" which is a market dominated by a few sellers. ""But most voters probably don’t know what an oligopoly is so they used the word ‘monopoly,’ which lots of people are familiar with."" Legal experts criticized the ad’s framing, repeating that the amendment needs 60% voter approval to pass, as any other Florida amendment would. That doesn’t amount to election rigging, the experts said.  Bob Jarvis, a law professor at south Florida’s Nova Southeastern University, said Florida is a huge untapped market for recreational marijuana sales, and companies often turn to ballot initiatives when they can’t get what they want from the Legislature alone.  But ""it is neither a monopoly amendment nor a special license amendment,"" he said. ""Florida companies and out-of-state companies will have to compete equally. Indeed, if any favoritism were to be shown to Florida companies, the out-of-state companies could sue under the Federal Constitution’s interstate commerce clause."" Smith, from the University of Florida, said campaigns that seek to defeat ballot issues typically try to find messages they think will erode support.  ""As we’ve seen in ballot issue campaigns concerning the legalization of recreational (or medical) marijuana, it’s often the fear factor of unintended consequences — a rash of new drug-related crime or kids getting hooked, or going after the vested interests of the proponents,"" Smith said. ""There’s no doubt that the marijuana companies will get rich, but they’re clearly not a monopoly."" Vote No on 3 said in an ad that ""Amendment 3 isn’t the marijuana amendment, it’s the monopoly amendment."" Large medical marijuana companies in Florida back the ballot measure to legalize marijuana for recreational use and one in particular, Trulieve, has contributed about $93 million to help the amendment pass. The measure says medical marijuana treatment centers, or other state licensed entities, will be able to sell recreational marijuana products without criminal or civil liability. Florida has about 25 licensed medical marijuana distributors with other applications pending. Nothing in the amendment establishes a monopoly; federal law prohibits monopolies. Rather, if 60% of the voters approve of the measure, it would take effect six months later and the Florida Legislature would determine licensing processes for recreational marijuana sellers. The state could license additional medical marijuana entities, and others that aren’t in the medical marijuana business.  We rate this claim False.

Kemp missed the call and called Biden back.  Kemp said Biden asked what Kemp needed and offered for Kemp to contact him directly. A Sept. 29 press pool report said Biden had spoken to Kemp and other leaders that day.,"In a Sept. 30 visit to Georgia after the state was devastated by Hurricane Helene, former President Trump falsely said that Gov. Brian Kemp could not reach President Joe Biden. The Category 4 hurricane had a death toll of  119 people  in the southeastern U.S. as of Sept. 30, and millions were without power and water. Trump visited a furniture store in Valdosta, Georgia, about 60 miles from where the storm made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region. Trump praised first responders and thanked Kemp, a Republican who did not appear with Trump, for ""working hard around the clock."" Trump  said  locals were doing the best they could in challenging circumstances.  ""We do need some help from the federal government. They have to get together, ideally, with the governor.

""And he just said, ‘Hey, what do you need?’ And I told him, ‘You know, we got what we need, we will work through the federal process.’ He offered that if there's other things we need, just to call him directly, which, I appreciate that."" Later Sept. 30, a reporter asked Biden about Trump’s remarks during a disaster response update.  ""He's lying and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden  said  of Trump.

politifact,Vice President Kamala Harris “even wants to legalize fentanyl.”,"A 2019 American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire asked candidates whether they supported decriminalization ""of all drug possession for personal use."" Then-Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate, marked the ""yes"" box and then wrote about legalizing marijuana.     In an interview on the ""All the Smoke"" podcast, released Sept. 30, Harris said ""I feel strongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed.""     During her 2024 campaign, Harris praised the border security bill and said ""it would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl.""","Former President Donald Trump vowed to stop fentanyl from pouring into the United States and said Vice President Kamala Harris has the opposite approach. ""Kamala is so radical she even wants to legalize fentanyl,"" Trump said Sept. 29 in  Erie, Pennsylvania .  A day earlier in Prairie du Chien,  Wisconsin , Trump went further: ""She's so radical she even wants to legalize fentanyl right away."" We looked at Harris’ record, including her time as vice president and 2024 presidential candidate, and she has not called to ""legalize"" fentanyl. The first thing to know is that fentanyl is legal as a pain management drug when prescribed by a doctor. But possession of fentanyl without a prescription or trafficking of the drug is a crime. Fentanyl is a  Schedule 2 drug,  which means it has an accepted medical use when prescribed or administered appropriately but has high abuse potential. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said fentanyl is ""about 100 times more potent"" than morphine.  The Biden-Harris administration proposed making fentanyl-related substances a  Schedule 1 drug , which would mean stiffer penalties for possession and distribution. Illicit fentanyl is often smuggled into the country through legal ports of entry, PolitiFact has reported. The federal National Institute on Drug Abuse also say some drug dealers  mix fentanyl  with other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine to increase potency, which can increase the risks of a lethal overdose.   There were 107,543 total drug overdose deaths in 2023, an estimated 74,702 of which involved fentanyl, recent  government data  shows. A Trump spokesperson said the former president was referring to Harris’ response to a  2019 questionnaire  by the American Civil Liberties Union in which she said she supported federally decriminalizing drug possession for personal use. The question, and her answer, did not mention fentanyl.  Trump said that Harris wants to ""legalize"" fentanyl, but the ACLU questionnaire asked about ""decriminalization."" Those words have different meanings. Decriminalization means that someone would not face criminal charges for illegal possession, but could face penalties, such as a fine. When people use ""decriminalization"" without specifics, it generally refers to possessing a small amount of a drug for personal use. There could still be rules after legalizing a drug, such as only adults can buy it. When she responded to the ACLU questionnaire about criminal justice issues, Harris was a U.S. senator from California running in the Democratic presidential primary. The 2019 ACLU survey prefaced a question about drugs with a discussion of racial disparities in drug arrests and incarceration rates. The ACLU wrote that ""the opioid crisis has reaffirmed the failure of criminalization,"" and ""full decriminalization with appropriate treatment responses could address this stark racial injustice and reduce incarceration.""  The  question  said: ""Since drug use is better addressed as a public health issue (through treatment and other programming), will you support the decriminalization at the federal level of all drug possession for personal use?""  Harris marked the ""yes"" box. She added a written reply focused on marijuana. ""I have co-sponsored the Marijuana Justice Act, which would legalize marijuana and believe it is long past time that we changed our outdated and discriminatory criminalization of marijuana. And throughout my career, I have supported treating drug addiction as a public health issue, focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration for drug-related offenses. Both of my Back-on-Track programs, made it a priority to connect individuals with substance abuse treatment as part of diversion and re-entry programming, in addition to employment,"" Harris wrote. The Harris campaign did not comment for this fact-check. But before the Sept. 10 Harris-Trump debate in Philadelphia, Fox News asked Harris campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler about her answer to the ACLU questionnaire. The reporter didn’t mention her reply on drugs, but referred to transgender surgery for  migrants in federal custody  and ""a lot of other things that were pretty far left."" Tyler  replied,  ""That questionnaire is not what she is proposing, it is not what she is running on."" Tyler didn’t mention drugs specifically, but said that on immigration she supported the bipartisan border security bill. The Trump campaign also pointed to comments by CNN KFile reporter  Andrew Kaczynski , who surfaced Harris’ responses on the ACLU questionnaire. Kaczynski  said  in a Sept. 10 interview that Harris’ answer on decriminalization raised questions. ""Now, what would that mean? Will it mean the federal, all drug possession, that's not just marijuana, which she alluded to in her answer to this question, but it also would mean … fentanyl, crack, you know, cocaine."" Harris opened herself up to these questions by checking ""yes"" for decriminalizing all drugs. Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio,  had a similar position  on marijuana but, unlike Harris, checked  ""no.""   Ryan wrote: ""No, I do not support the decriminalization at the federal level of all drug possession for personal use. However, I do support the decriminalization and legalization of Marijuana."" Trump said Harris ""wants"" to legalize fentanyl as president. We found no statements from her campaign or vice presidency to support this claim. By contrast, Harris has called for more enforcement. The Biden-Harris administration released an opioid-related plan July 31 that ""would permanently regulate fentanyl-related substances as ‘Schedule I’ drugs — subjecting the distribution and possession of these drugs to heightened penalties."" In July 2023, Harris met with a  group of state attorneys general  about efforts to disrupt the fentanyl supply chain. A White House summary of the meeting said they discussed efforts to ""to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and expand access to care."" A  Harris TV ad in August  said she ""will hire thousands more border agents and crack down on fentanyl and human trafficking."" Harris praised the border security bill that Trump opposed at a  Sept. 19 event with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan . ""It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl,"" Harris said. In a Sept. 27  speech at the border in Arizona , Harris called fentanyl ""a scourge on our country."" ""So, as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl into the United States,"" Harris said. ""I will ensure we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain, because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl into our country."" We asked drug policy experts whether Harris’ comments support that she ""wants to legalize fentanyl."" No experts said they viewed Harris as wanting to legalize fentanyl. ""I have seen no evidence that Harris has spoken about legalizing fentanyl,"" said Dr. Sally Satel, a lecturer at the Yale University School of Medicine and senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow in the foreign policy program at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said Trump’s claim is ""preposterous.""  Felbab-Brown said Harris has consistently called for prosecuting illegal criminal groups and suppliers while supporting evidence-based treatment and the use of Naloxone, a medicine that reverses overdoses from opioids such as fentanyl.  As for the ACLU questionnaire, ""favoring policy A for one drug does not imply that one must favor policy A for all drugs,"" said Jonathan Caulkins, Carnegie Mellon University public policy professor. ""So answering a question about all drugs by reference to policy toward a single drug is ducking the question."" In an interview on an "" All the Smoke"" podcast  released Sept. 30, Harris spoke in favor of not imprisoning people for personal marijuana use. ""I feel strongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed,"" Harris  said . ""We need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior. This is not a new position for me."" Trump said Harris ""even wants to legalize fentanyl.""  Trump spoke in the present tense as if it is on her presidential to-do list. She hasn’t said that. Trump was referring to a 2019 ACLU questionnaire that asked presidential primary candidates whether they supported decriminalization ""of all drug possession for personal use.""  Harris marked the ""yes"" box and wrote an answer on legalizing marijuana. This invites questions about whether she meant all drugs or just marijuana. But Harris’ record as vice president and the Democratic presidential nominee shows she does not want to legalize fentanyl.  Harris has continued in this presidential campaign to say she wants to decriminalize marijuana possession, but has also said she wants to halt the flow of illicit fentanyl.

politifact,"Says immigrants with temporary protections in Springfield, Ohio, are “illegal immigrants.”","Most of the immigrants who recently settled in Springfield, Ohio, are allowed to temporarily live and work in the country legally.      Both humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status are considered lawful statuses under immigration law, immigration experts said.     Neither program allows people to stay permanently. ​","CBS News moderators muted vice presidential candidates’ microphones only once during the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate: during a discussion about immigration. Specifically, when they were on the topic of immigration in Springfield, Ohio — the small midwestern city thrown into the national spotlight after former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, spread baseless claims about immigrants eating pets. The point in question: Are Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, in the U.S. illegally? Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., criticized Vance for spreading misinformation about Springfield’s Haitian immigrants. Moderators gave Vance a minute to respond. ""In Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,"" Vance said. Walz spoke again before moderator and CBS News’ ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan stepped in.  ""And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status: Temporary Protected Status,"" Brennan said. ""Margaret, The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check, and since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So, there's an application called the CBP One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card and waiting for 10 years."" We rated Vance’s statement about the phone app, which is a scheduling tool, not an application for asylum or parole,  Mostly False . For this claim, we’ll focus on Haitian immigrants in Springfield, whom  city officials say  account for most of the immigrants who have settled there in the past four years: Are they in the U.S. legally?  We can’t confirm the status of every immigrant who has recently moved to the city. But  local  and  state  officials said most are there legally, because they’re in the U.S. under temporary legal protections,  humanitarian parole  and  Temporary Protected Status .  Immigration law experts told PolitiFact that Haitians in these temporary programs are in the U.S. legally. Vance’s spokesperson did not respond to our request for comment. But Vance has previously  said about Haitian migrants : ""If Kamala Harris waves a wand, illegally, and says these people are now here legally, I'm still going to call them illegal aliens."" President Joe Biden has created and expanded ways for Haitians, and other immigrants, to temporarily live and work in the U.S. legally.  Humanitarian parole for applicants outside the U.S.:  In January 2023, Biden expanded a humanitarian parole program for Venezuelans to include Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans. Under the  program , every month, up to 30,000 eligible people can receive humanitarian parole, allowing them to legally enter the U.S. and live and work here for up to two years. To qualify for the program, people need to apply from outside the U.S. and have a U.S. sponsor, such as a family member.  As of August, nearly 214,000 Haitians had entered the U.S. under this humanitarian parole. Temporary Protected Status:  In June 2024, the Biden administration  expanded and redesignated  Temporary Protected Status for Haitian immigrants. People who have Temporary Protected Status are protected from deportation. This protection is granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people from certain countries undergoing war, environmental disasters and epidemics. The program also allows eligible immigrants to legally live and work in the U.S. for six- to 18-month periods. Temporary Protected Status beneficiaries must be in the U.S. at the time of their home country’s designation to apply. Before the June redesignation, about 200,000  Haitians benefited from the temporary protection . The June action allowed any Haitian who met eligibility requirements and had been living in the U.S. by June 3, 2024, to apply. DHS  estimated  309,000 additional Haitians would be eligible. People can apply for Temporary Protected Status whether they entered the U.S. legally or illegally. Humanitarian parole at U.S. ports of entry:  In January 2023, Biden expanded the use of CBP One, the scheduling phone application launched by the Trump administration, to allow people in Mexico to schedule appointments at official U.S. ports of entry. There, immigration officials can give people humanitarian parole for up to two years, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. as they apply for asylum. From January 2023 to May 2024, 119,000 Haitians scheduled appointments using the app; we don’t know how many were granted this parole. These programs give Haitians a lawful status in the U.S. The Immigration and Nationality Act  describes  people on Temporary Protected Status as ""being in, and maintaining, lawful status as a nonimmigrant."" The term "" nonimmigrant "" refers to people who are in the U.S. temporarily. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  says on its website that people with humanitarian parole or Temporary Protected Status have ""lawful immigration status."" Immigration law gives the executive branch the authority to grant people these protections, Jean Reisz, co-director of the University of Southern California Immigration Clinic said. We asked the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within the department, about the immigration status of people with Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole. We did not hear back. But immigration law experts said that, once immigrants have Temporary Protected Status protections, they are in the U.S. legally — regardless of how they entered the U.S. before receiving it. However, Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole do not provide people a pathway to citizenship. So, people with humanitarian parole or Temporary Protected Status must use  another avenue  — such as asylum, marriage or employment — to gain legal permanent residence. That leaves people who have these protections in a ""precarious non-permanent status"" that can expire or be ended by the president, Reisz said. In November 2017, for example, Trump  tried to end  Temporary Protected Status for Haitians. Legal challenges halted the termination. Trump is again  promising  to revoke Haiti’s Temporary Protected Status, if elected. If protections expire or are terminated, people revert to the status they had before these protections, Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of University of California Los Angeles’ Center for Immigration Law and Policy said. And people who don’t have a legal basis to stay in the U.S. would have to leave the country or be subject to deportation, Reisz said. But that deportation wouldn’t be immediate, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University  immigration law professor. ""They would all have a right to a removal hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether they have some right to remain here, such as asylum,"" Yale-Loehr said. That could take years because of immigration court backlogs. Vance said immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are ""illegal immigrants."" City officials say most of the immigrants who recently arrived in Springfield are Haitians. We don’t know the immigration status for all of them, but officials have said that many are in the country under humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status. These protections allow them to temporarily live and work in the country legally. Both humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status are considered lawful statuses under immigration law, immigration experts said. Neither program lets people stay permanently in the U.S. But while the temporary protection is in place, they are not here illegally, immigration experts said.

Project 2025 is the conservative Heritage Foundation’s 922-page guide for an incoming Republican administration.","Hurricane Helene brought deadly storm surge, heavy winds and torrential rain that caused infrastructure-destroying flooding. As of Oct. 3, the storm and its aftermath had killed more than 190 people across six states and caused at least  $20 billion   in damage .  With the crisis still unfolding, some social media users focused on the federal government’s response — and how that response might change if Republicans win November’s presidential election.  ""FEMA is going to be gutted. It’s written into Project 2025,""  a Sept. 28  Threads video said. Project 2025 will ""cut FEMA"" and ""kill federal-backed flood insurance,"" said similar  posts  from  critics  of former President Donald Trump. FEMA refers to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Project 2025 is the conservative Heritage Foundation’s  922-page guide  for an incoming Republican administration. Democrats have linked Project 2025 to Trump  when attacking its proposals , but the document is neither an official Trump campaign position nor a Republican Party platform. Trump has recently sought to distance himself from Project 2025, but several, high-ranking former Trump administration officials wrote it. Trump said in an April 2022  keynote speech  that the Heritage Foundation would ""lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do."" Experts on emergency management and the federal budget said that several of Project 2025’s suggestions constituted significant cuts to FEMA.  Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at the federal budget-tracking group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Project 2025 lacked necessary detail to evaluate the exact impact of its proposals. ""Changes called for in this piece could ultimately lead to less predictable, more expensive federal disaster response,"" he said. A Project 2025 spokesperson said the plan’s proposals advocate shifting the agency’s focus away from climate change initiatives. The full Project 2025 document mentions FEMA — in shorthand or by its full name — about 30 times, most often in a section written by Ken Cuccinelli, who served as Trump’s  acting   deputy secretary of Homeland Security .  Cuccinelli outlined four primary changes:  Changing the cost-share arrangement with local governments so that the federal government often covers 25% instead of at least 75%. Privatizing the National Flood Insurance Program, which provides federally backed flood insurance to property owners and renters in participating communities. Terminating FEMA’s grants. Raising the per capita threshold for providing FEMA public assistance to disaster-stricken communities. The plan also says that FEMA should be moved to the Interior Department or potentially combined with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and both be moved to the Transportation Department. Kathryn Van Tol, a legal fellow of emergency management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill who once worked in North Carolina’s Division of Emergency Management, said that removing FEMA’s direct access to the Department of Homeland Security’s resources ""could slow response and recovery."" Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris attends a briefing at FEMA headquarters, Sept. 30, 2024, in Washington, on recovery and assistance efforts after Hurricane Helene. (AP) After a president declares a disaster, affected areas qualify for several disaster relief programs, most of which require states, tribes or territories to  cover a share of eligible costs .  In most cases, FEMA covers at least 75% of the costs — sometimes increasing that funding for larger disasters — and the state or the jurisdiction receiving the funding covers the remaining 25%.  Project 2025  advocates for  Congress to ""change the cost-share arrangement,"" so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters ""with the cost share reaching a maximum of 75 percent for truly catastrophic disasters.""  It said it  planned  to adjust FEMA’s spending ""to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.""  But it doesn’t define what qualifies as ""small"" or ""truly catastrophic."" Sewell of Taxpayers for Common Sense said the change could constitute a significant cut, ""but we can’t tell"" without those definitions.  The change would ""effectively invert the cost share for disaster relief"" and leave local communities to bear three-quarters of the costs, Van Tol said.   Two adults and two children arrive to their flooded home in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Sept. 27, 2024, in Crystal River, Fla. (AP) The  National Flood Insurance Program  often serves as an insurer of last resort in high-risk areas that private insurers avoid.  Project 2025  calls for  the program to be ""wound down and replaced with private insurance."" A Project 2025 spokesperson proposed phasing out government coverage in low-risk zones where private insurers could enter the market. The phase-out would then expand to higher-risk areas that would see risk-based pricing and possible tax credits — or a hybrid public-private model providing a federal backstop.  Experts said such a scenario is unlikely given that private insurers have been historically unwilling to shoulder the risk of insuring properties in designated floodplains. ""The private sector has made very clear they’re not going to assume that risk,"" said Craig Fugate, who headed FEMA in the Obama administration after leading Florida’s emergency management under then-Gov. Jeb Bush. ""They made that decision back in the ’60s, and it hasn't changed."" Sewell said eliminating the program ""inevitably would mean many homeowners would either not have an insurance option, because a private insurance company does not step in, or would effectively not have one because a true risk-based rate would be unaffordable.""  Grants are the ""principle funding mechanism"" FEMA uses to provide money for pre- and post-emergency or disaster-related projects, according to  its website .   Its  preparedness grants  provide matching funds to supplement states’ and local governments’ efforts to prepare for emergencies, Fugate said. But Project 2025 said FEMA grants should be terminated and states ""should bear the costs of their particularized programs"" instead.   States that experience disasters more often have more invested in preparedness efforts independent of federal support. But in parts of the country that budget for and have fewer disasters, terminating federal grants could amount to ""cutting their programs in half,"" Fugate said. FEMA also manages the  Homeland Security Grant Program , which includes grants created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to ""enhance national preparedness"" by building urban search and rescue teams and creating mobile command posts, Fugate said.  Using these grants, local entities have built up their response capacity, which means FEMA does less disaster response, Fugate said.  In many cases, the annual grant funding ""is maintaining this capability that we built, not necessarily adding more to it,"" he said. ""If you cut that program, I’m afraid we’d lose a lot of that capacity."" Cutting FEMA’s local preparedness grants could mean eliminating ""half the salary of your local emergency manager."" Cutting the Homeland Security grants could reduce funding for ""formal communication systems that were sent into areas that lost all their public safety communications"" during Hurricane Helene, he said. Fugate and Sewell said terminating the grants would also be politically unpopular, regardless of political affiliation.    Van Tol said it would eliminate FEMA staff, reduce grant managers at local levels, and hinder local governments’ abilities ""to effectively respond in a disaster to protect life and property of the citizens."" Two Sheriff deputies walk on the main street in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Oct. 2, 2024, in Chimney Rock Village, N.C. (AP) FEMA’s Public Assistance Program  provides grants  to state, tribal and local governments and eligible nonprofits to help them recover from major disasters. FEMA partly  determines whether a community qualifies  for such a grant using a ""per capita"" or  per-person  estimated cost of assistance evaluation. In 2024, the  per capita threshold  across a state is $1.84 and for a county is $4.60. ""FEMA should raise the threshold,""  Project 2025 sai d, arguing that the threshold ""has not kept pace with inflation."" Alternatively, the document advocated for ""applying a deductible"" to encourage ""states to take a more proactive role in their own preparedness and response capabilities.""  Van Tol said raising the per capita threshold ""would result in less disasters being declared in the first place.""  The per capita threshold is increased periodically, but not every year, experts said. In 2020, FEMA  proposed increasing  the cost threshold for assistance, but a final rule has not been issued.  Van Tol said the threshold isn’t arbitrary: It’s ""tied to the consumer price index"" and ""is intended to be a current reflection of market conditions.""  Fugate said FEMA’s efforts to raise the per capita threshold are ""met with a firestorm of opposition from both sides of the aisle in Congress."" Social media posts said Project 2025 would ""cut FEMA"" and ""kill federal-backed flood insurance.""   Project 2025’s proposed FEMA changes include raising the per capita threshold for providing FEMA public assistance, terminating its grants, replacing the National Flood Insurance Program with privatized insurance and changing FEMA’s cost-share so that federal government covers less of the cost for smaller disaster response and recovery.  Experts told PolitiFact that if these proposals became reality — surviving congressional opposition and overcoming what is likely to be limited private insurers’ support — they would reduce FEMA’s support to state and local governments, hinder disaster response and leave property owners with greater exposure and fewer options.

politifact,"North Carolina removed 747,000 voters from the voter rolls to try to “steal the election.”","The North Carolina State Board of Elections said  the state had removed about 747,000 voters from its voter rolls since January 2023.      A board spokesperson and multiple election experts said the removals reflect routine voter list maintenance, as prescribed by state and federal law.       It was not a one-time purge of voters, experts said.","On Sept. 26, North Carolina said it had removed almost 750,000 ineligible people from its voter rolls since January 2023.  Misinformation immediately followed. One  Sept. 26 Instagram post  featured a screenshot that included an X post from  The Hill  that read, ""North Carolina removes 747,000 from voter rolls, citing ineligibility,"" along with a link to an article. In reply, another X user pointed out how close recent elections in North Carolina have been. ""They’re trying to steal the election right before our eyes,"" the  Instagram post  concluded. On Sept. 29, an X user  cast doubt  on the action’s legitimacy — while simultaneously acknowledging that nothing seemed amiss: ""So we have zero evidence of any wrongdoing but conveniently a month away the republicans do this. Smells like election fraud to me."" These characterizations of the removals are inaccurate.  North Carolina’s State Board of Elections explained why it removed registrants, and experts told PolitiFact that the move appeared to be normal voter roll cleanup, which state law requires.  The  bipartisan  North Carolina State Board of Elections, three Democrats and two Republicans, said in a  news release  that county election officials had removed 747,274 ""ineligible registration records"" from the state’s voter rolls.  Although that is a large number, North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson Patrick Gannon told PolitiFact this ""was not a one-time ‘purge,’"" of voters. ""The 747,000 ineligible voter records were removed from the voter rolls gradually over the past 20 months,"" since January 2023, Gannon said.  Nearly  7.7 million people are registered to vote  in North Carolina. U.S. Census Bureau data estimated that North Carolina had a voting age population of  about 8.5 million  as of July 2023. Gannon said registrants were removed ""for various and valid reasons, as required by state and federal laws."" In its news release, the board further explained why records can be removed, including if a registrant:  Moved to a different county or out of state.  Was inactive for two federal  general elections  — meaning two elections in which U.S. senators, U.S. representatives and/or the president are  elected to office  — and did not respond after their county board of elections sent mailers trying to confirm their eligibility.  Died. Was convicted of a felony and is serving some sort of sentence. Had a duplicate registration.  Asked to be removed.  Was the subject of a successful  voter challenge .  Was not a U.S. citizen.  Ann Webb, policy director for Common Cause North Carolina, a voting rights advocacy group, said North Carolina’s news release doesn’t mean eligible voters were removed from the voter rolls entirely — it signals that the rolls were ""cleaned up.""  ""The most common reason why someone was listed as having been ‘removed’ from the voter rolls was because they showed up and registered in another place,"" she said. ""They moved out of that county and they were registered in another county.""  Most removals were in 2023. In 2024, North Carolina removed about 224,500 registrants from its voter rolls. Gannon said concerned voters can check that their voter record is alive and up to date through the state’s  voter search tool .  ""Election officials take great care not to remove eligible voters and rely only on official sources of information when conducting list maintenance, as required by law,"" he said. Multiple election experts said the removal of about 747,000 registrants from North Carolina’s voter rolls across nearly two years reflects normal list maintenance, which  state and   federal law  requires. The 1993  National Voter Registration Act  created rules for when election officials can remove people from voter rolls if they didn’t ask to be removed. It requires states to have a uniform and nondiscriminatory process for removing people from voter rolls, according to the  Justice Department . With some exceptions, states must complete voter roll maintenance no later than 90 days before an election. Webb said the actions described in the state board’s  news release  signaled that North Carolina election officials complied with those laws.   ""It’s really critical that folks understand this was not a sudden action,"" Webb said of the removals. The news release ""was a report on 20 months worth of work in all 100 counties across the state."" David Becker, the executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonpartisan group that works with election officials from both political parties to build trust in elections,  wrote  on X that the number of removals was expected, ""reflecting people who have died or moved out of NC in the last 20 months.""

""This is all part of their statutorily required voter list maintenance."" Eligible North Carolina voters with a North Carolina driver’s license or other ID can  register online to vote  until Oct. 11. After that, people can  register and vote  from Oct. 17 to Nov. 2 at any early voting site in their county. Voters in North Carolina cannot register to vote on Election Day, Nov. 5.  An Instagram post said North Carolina removed 747,00 voters from the voter rolls to try to ""steal the election.""  The State Board of Elections said that about 747,000 voters had been removed from the states’ voter rolls since January 2023, but this was neither covert nor illegal.

politifact,"""Missouri registered 78,421 in just one week of February of this year. Out of that number, 23,253 were dead people!""","The Social Security Administration’s Help America Vote Verification database doesn’t show the number of people who have registered to vote in the United States.   	  The database shows the overall number of times a state has requested the verification of a potential voter’s Social Security number.  	  Requests can be made multiple times for a single person, adding to the overall numbers featured in the database.","As the 2024 presidential election draws closer, social media users are crying foul over what they claim is an instance of voter fraud in Missouri.  An  Instagram reel  shared a screenshot  from X  that claimed state voter registrations spiked unusually. ""Missouri registered 78,421 in just ONE WEEK of February of this year,"" the screenshotted post claimed. ""Out of that number, 23,253 were DEAD PEOPLE! Here we go, AGAIN!"" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about  our partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) The screenshot cited Tim Pool, a conservative commentator and podcaster, as its source.  Pool talked about the registrations during  an April 3 episode of his podcast , saying the figures came from the Social Security Administration’s Help America Vote Verification database for the  week of Feb. 17 .  ""These are voter registrations where someone is trying to use a Social Security number and a name, and when it came back to the (Social Security Administration), they said that person is dead,"" Pool said.  He questioned how it didn’t strike officials as ""odd"" that nearly a third of the people who tried to register to vote in Missouri that week were not alive. (Pool is one of six Tenet Media  content creators  whose work is under scrutiny following a federal indictment alleging two employees of Russia-owned broadcaster RT paid Tenet to push pro-Russian propaganda.)  Social Security Administration and Missouri secretary of state officials said Pool’s framing of the data was incorrect. The Help America Vote Verification database shows the number of verification requests sent by a state’s election office to confirm a person’s eligibility to vote — not the number of people who registered to vote in a given week — a Social Security Administration spokesperson said in a statement sent to PolitiFact.  ""Under the Help America Vote Act, when a voter registrant does not have a driver’s license, states are permitted to submit the voter registrant’s name, date of birth and last four digits of their Social Security number to the Social Security Administration for verification,"" the statement said.  Forty-three states  use the database, which  tracks the total number of verification requests processed in a given week. It breaks down how many requests can be matched to people who are alive or dead. It does not tally the number of people who are registered to vote or who are trying to register to vote.  In a  previous fact-check  related to the database, PolitiFact found that states can run a verification request for a person multiple times, contributing to the overall numbers.  JoDonn Chaney, communications director for the Missouri secretary of state’s office, told PolitiFact that the state’s local election authorities have a mandate to clean their voter rolls. As part of that process, they would periodically ping the database to determine who should be removed, based on whether they had left the state or died.  ""We don’t have that information of people attempting to register based on the number (referred to in the claim),"" he said. ""We don’t see that as people attempting to register to vote.""  Chaney provided a month-by-month breakdown of the state’s number of registered voters, showing the video’s claim was off base.  Missouri had 4,270,843 voters in January and 4,268,935 million in February — a decline of 1,908. The total number of voters in the state dropped by 574 people in March to 4,268,361. The state in April had an increase of 20,250 registered voters, bringing the total number for that month to 4,288,611. Madison Walker, a Missouri secretary of state’s office communication specialist, said there’s no specific reason for the spike, but the timing coincided with presidential caucuses and general municipal elections. The state never had 78,421 people register to vote within a single week.    An Instagram reel claimed data from the Social Security Administration showed that Missouri ""registered 78,421 in just one week of February of this year"" and that ""23,253 were dead people!"" The numbers cited in the claim come from the administration’s Help America Vote Verification database, which states use to verify people’s voter information. States can send multiple verification requests for a single person, which adds to the overall numbers shown in the database.  These numbers don’t represent voter registrations.

politifact,The Biden administration stole $1 billion “from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants. … And FEMA is now busted. They don’t have any money.”,"Starting in 2019, during the Trump administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been funding migrants’ food, shelter and transportation through two programs that give money to nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.      This funding does not come at disaster victims’ expense. Neither of the programs for migrants uses money from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. Congress funds the migrant and disaster relief programs separately.     FEMA is not out of money. The agency’s Disaster Relief Fund was facing a funding deficit before Hurricane Helene hit Sept. 26. This is not unusual; nearly every year since 2017, Congress has approved extra funding for the agency.","As he arrived in Augusta, Georgia, to survey Hurricane Helene’s devastation, former President Donald Trump said the Biden-Harris administration’s spending on immigrants has left the Federal Emergency Management Agency broke.  ""Well, for one thing, $1 billion was stolen from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants,""  Trump said  Oct. 4. He added, ""And FEMA is now busted. They don’t have any money.""  He continued, ""FEMA has not done the job, meaning the federal government, Kamala and Joe, have not done the job obviously. They have $1 billion, $1 billion with a 'B,' missing that's supposed to be used for hurricanes and things like that and they don't have any money."" Trump used his visit to the hurricane-ravaged battleground state as an opportunity to attack his opponent, Kamala Harris, and argue that she cares more about immigrants in the U.S. illegally than Americans. He has repeated versions of that claim since Oct. 3: ""Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country,"" he said at an Oct. 3  campaign rally  in Saginaw, Michigan. ""We’re missing $1 billion that they gave to migrants coming into our country,"" he said in an  Oct. 4 town hall  in Fayetteville, North Carolina. ""The GREAT people of North Carolina are being stood up by Harris and Biden, who are giving almost all of the FEMA money to Illegal Migrants,"" he  wrote Oct. 7 on Truth Social . He added: ""NORTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY ABANDONED BY KAMALA!!!"" Here are the facts: Current FEMA funding for migrants does not come at disaster relief’s expense. Neither of FEMA’s two programs for migrants uses money from the agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, which is primarily used after natural disasters. Congress funds the migrant and disaster relief programs separately. And Trump’s administration, not Biden’s, shifted FEMA funding — including money from the Disaster Relief Fund — to address immigration.  When contacted for comment, the Trump campaign pointed to spending by FEMA’s  Shelter and Services Program , which gives money to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations that provide migrants with  temporary shelter, food and transportation . Trump arrived at the $1 billion figure by combining the  fiscal year 2023 and 2024 budgets  for the Shelter and Services Program. ""FEMA has been  spending  hundreds of millions of dollars on the transportation and shelter of illegal immigrants,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. That’s different from Trump’s claims, which distort the facts.  FEMA’s rumor response  website  says no money from the Disaster Relief Fund was diverted for immigration. The White House  issued a similar statement . It’s inaccurate to describe the $1 billion as ""stolen,"" said Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense.  Congress — not the president — decides how much money government programs receive. The Biden-Harris administration requested the money from Congress, and Congress granted it to FEMA for the Shelter and Services program. ""It’s definitely not stealing,"" Sewell said. ""It is in an appropriations bill."" FEMA is expected to face a deficit during the current fiscal year that started Oct. 1, but the agency is not out of money. And Congress can set aside more money, as it has done nearly every year since 2017, Sewell said.  Directing federal money to help states and cities handle immigrant influxes didn’t start with the Biden-Harris administration. With Congress deadlocked for decades over immigration bills,  state and local politicians  in red and blue areas have  demanded  that the federal government step up and provide money to help provide basic services to new immigrants.  Starting in 2019, as illegal immigration ticked up during Trump’s administration, Congress  gave  FEMA funding to expand its Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which previously had been used only for people facing homelessness and hunger, to include migrant support services. FEMA gave federal money to local and state governments and nonprofit organizations that provide services to immigrants whom officials have released into the U.S. to await court proceedings. Neither that program nor the one that replaced it was, or is, funded with money promised to FEMA’s disaster relief work. And the Biden administration didn’t transfer money from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund to either program, the White House said in an Oct. 5  memo . Sewell reiterated this point: ""The Disaster Relief Fund has nothing to do with any migrant assistance account because all that spending is from separate funds.""  In 2023, Congress directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection and FEMA to create the Shelter and Services Program for migrants, removing immigration grants from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. The Shelter and Services Program uses money Congress has given Customs and Border Protection, and is administered by FEMA. In  fiscal year 2024 , which started October 2023 and ended September 2024, Congress  directed  U.S. Customs and Border Protection to give FEMA $650 million for the Shelter and Services Program. From  fiscal years 2021 to 2024 , Congress has set aside about $1.5 billion combined for both the Shelter and Services and Emergency Food and Shelter programs. The money is  used for  food, shelter and medical care.  Statements from Trump and other Republicans saying FEMA is out of money stem from Oct. 2  comments  to journalists by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as he traveled to South Carolina to survey devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. But Mayorkas didn’t say FEMA was out of money. When a reporter asked Mayorkas about FEMA funding, he said, ""We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting. FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the (hurricane) season,"" which lasts from June through November. Mayorkas said the Biden-Harris administration has  requested additional  funding from Congress. Congress has approved extra money for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund nearly every year since 2017, totaling nearly $170 billion, Sewell said. This money is on top of the $100 billion Congress has set aside in annual legislation. On Sept. 26,  Congress added $20 billion  to the disaster fund as part of a stopgap bill to fund the government through Dec. 20.  Even before Hurricane Helene made landfall, the Disaster Relief Fund was headed toward a deficit. A mid-September  report FEMA published  before Hurricane Helene projected a deficit starting in February 2025. That was also before Hurricane Milton. When Trump was president, his administration shifted FEMA funding, including money from the Disaster Relief Fund, to address immigration. In 2019, the  Department of Homeland Security announced  it was ""reprogramming"" some funds Congress had set aside.The department said it would transfer $271 million to immigration efforts. That included about $155 million from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund base budget.  PolitiFact found in 2019 that the funding shift would not deplete FEMA’s available funding for disaster-hit areas; the federal government  has a process  to provide disaster relief. But we wrote it could have some effect, depending on the storm season’s severity. Trump said ""$1 billion was stolen from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants. … And FEMA is now busted. They don’t have any money.""  This is a gross mischaracterization.   The Biden-Harris administration did not ""steal"" money from FEMA. Congress — not the president — decides how much money government programs receive. Congress approved FEMA funding to give grants to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations for immigrant services. The program’s funding comes from Customs and Border Protection, and is separate from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund that’s used to respond to natural disasters. The money for immigrants does not come at storm victims’ expense. The federal government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on hurricane recovery and will continue to do so.  Furthermore, FEMA is not out of money. The agency’s Disaster Relief Fund is expected to face a deficit, but that’s unrelated to the program for immigrants. Congress can step in and provide more funding for FEMA, as it has done nearly every year since 2017. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

We found no evidence that he’s been to Gaza.     President Bill Clinton visited Gaza in 1998; experts said he’s the last president to visit Gaza.","In an interview that aired on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, former President Donald Trump said that he had been to Gaza. Conservative radio show host  Hugh Hewitt  asked Trump whether Gaza could ""be Monaco if it was rebuilt the right way? Could someone make Gaza into something that all the Palestinian people would be proud of, would want to live in, would benefit them?"" Trump said it could be the ""most beautiful place."" ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything. It’s got, it is the best, I’ve said it for years,"" Trump said. ""You know when — I’ve been there, and it’s rough. It’s a rough place, before the, you know, before all of the attacks and before the back and forth what’s happened over the last couple of years."" We asked the Trump campaign when he was in Gaza, who he was with and what he did there. The response we received did not answer those questions. ""President Trump has been to Gaza previously and has always worked to ensure peace in the Middle East,"" Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson said. ""He negotiated the historic Abraham Accords and brought stability to the region, which has unfortunately been destabilized again due to the Harris-Biden Administration’s weakness.""  During Trump’s presidency, the Abraham Accords normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab countries, but Gaza was not a partner. Leaders of Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco signed the  Abraham Accords in 2020.   The New York Times ,  The Washington Post  and  CNN  found no evidence that Trump visited Gaza. Neither did we. Several experts on Israel or Gaza told us that they had no evidence that Trump as president visited Gaza. Trump-appointed former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker  told CNN : ""As far as I know, he’s never traveled there. He did not go in 2017 when he visited Israel."" A Trump campaign official who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity said, ""Gaza is in Israel. President Trump has been to Israel.""  Gaza is not in Israel. Israel has  occupied Gaza since 1967  following the Six-Day War, but it never annexed it.  Trump has been to the West Bank, another territory occupied by Israel and home to Palestinians. On May 23, 2017, Trump met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem in the West Bank, according to a  State Department record of Trump’s presidential travels.  That record does not mention Gaza. The same week, Trump also met in Jerusalem with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  After meeting with Abbas, Trump  said  he hoped to achieve a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The last U.S. president to visit Gaza was Bill Clinton. On Dec. 14 1998, Clinton spoke to the Palestinian National Council in Gaza City. ""This is a remarkable day,""  Clinton said  ""Today the eyes of the world are on you. I am profoundly honored to be the first American president to address the Palestinian people in a city governed by Palestinians."" Clinton cut the ribbon  signifying the opening of the Gaza International Airport and stood alongside Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Ezzedine C. Fishere, a senior lecturer on Middle East politics at Dartmouth College, said Clinton’s appearance ""was a huge deal for the Palestinians: world recognition, promise of a peaceful and dignified future, prospect of statehood — the embodiment of the best elements the Oslo agreements could offer."" Daniel Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Israel and Egypt and now a Princeton University professor, said that Clinton went to Gaza after being assured that Arafat would renounce or change the  PLO Charter  that had called for Israel’s destruction.  ""The security situation in Gaza, even before October 7, was enough of a reason for presidents not to visit,"" Kurtzer said. ""The other reason was/is the fact that the Palestinian Authority headquarters is in Ramallah in the West Bank."" Clinton visited Gaza at a peaceful time, said Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations who served in President George W. Bush’s administration. No president has been there since, largely because of security concerns, Abrams said.  The State Department has  repeatedly  warned Americans to avoid Gaza. The  U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem said Oct. 7, 2023 , the day Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, that the ""U.S. government personnel continue to be prohibited from travel to Gaza and areas within seven (7) miles of Gaza. ""   Hamas is an Islamic militant group that  formed in Gaza in the 1980s . The U.S. State Department designated it as a terrorist group in 1997. Hamas in 2006 won elections in the Palestinian territories and in 2007 took over Gaza. Hamas’ attack on multiple sites in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, was the deadliest attack on Israel in decades. Fishere said that if Trump has visited Gaza, it must have been before 2006. Trump said he had been to Gaza. His campaign provided no evidence that Trump visited Gaza. The State Department keeps a public log of presidents’ travels. It does not list Gaza as a place Trump visited. Multiple Middle East policy experts said Clinton was the last president to visit Gaza.

Tammy Baldwin.","Twelve years might sound like a long time ago, but it isn’t enough for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.  The committee put out an attack ad against Wisconsin Republican senatorial candidate Eric Hovde that says Hovde ""brags about being in the 1%.""  In campaigning, labeling an opponent as part of ""the 1%"" is akin to a political slur, casting them as out of touch with the rest of the 99% and those whom the economy and personal finances are top of mind.  Hovde, a millionaire banker and real estate mogul, is running against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat. Did Hovde brag about being part of the 1%? When we asked the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for backup, it pointed us to an interview from 12 years ago.  In 2012, Hovde dipped into political waters in Wisconsin, running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate. He would eventually lose the primary to former Gov. Tommy Thompson, who then lost to Baldwin. On July 12, 2012, Hovde did an interview with conservative radio host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM (1130)  and talked about his family background. ""I love our country. It’s afforded my great-grandparents and grandpa, who immigrated here from Norway who came with nothing, I mean the shirt on their back and a little satchel, and to make a life for themselves,"" Hovde said.  So far, it’s a pretty typical American story of generations coming to the country with limited resources.  ""And then for my father to prosper and then for me to have an opportunity, that’s what America has been about,"" Hovde said.  Then there is a shift in tone. ""And instead (Democrats) have totally distorted our economic system. I’m now supposed to feel guilty because I work hard and succeeded in life and have done good and employed people and helped support their families and given money away to people who are struggling,"" Hovde said. ""But now I’m bad because I’m the 1%? I mean, what’s happened?"" So, he did label himself as part of the 1%. But, it’s important to note that the quote was from more than a decade ago, while the ad positions it as if Hovde is continually making such claims — or at least has made them during this campaign. In July, Hovde had listed assets worth between $195.4 million and $564.5 million according to a financial disclosure form.  In comparison, Baldwin reported in May having assets worth between $601,003 and nearly $1.3 million, according to financial disclosure records.  We reached out to the Hovde campaign for a response to the ad but they did not address the point. Instead campaign spokesman Zach Bannon avoided the topic and asked a rhetorical question pointing to Baldwin’s donors, her partner and her  $1.3 million condo in Washington, D.C. But when given the chance to respond, the Hovde campaign did not deny or add other context to the claim that he bragged about being part of the 1%.  The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claimed Hovde ""brags about being in the 1%"" in an ad based on a quote from 12 years ago.  The Hovde campaign doesn’t deny the claim or add additional context, but instead deflects onto his opponent. However the quote is 12 years old and the ad makes it seem as if Hovde said it more recently.  We rate this claim as Mostly True. ",mostly-true,Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,2024-09-20,2024-10-10,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/hovde_rnc/27b010807b75ebe18c52b0e84d175315.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/10/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/did-eric-hovde-brag-about-being-in-the-1-his-campa/,"Elections, Wealth, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee"
politifact,"Says Democratic opponent Tammy Baldwin ""gave stimulus checks to illegals.""",Immigrants in the country illegally were not eligible for stimulus checks under the American Rescue Plan.      The American Rescue Plan required people receiving stimulus checks to have valid Social Security numbers.,"The U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin is heating up as the November election draws near, with a flurry of news releases and campaign ads from incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Republican challenger Eric Hovde.  One  Hovde ad  in particular caught our attention: an interview featuring a man and woman saying Baldwin ""gave stimulus checks to illegals.""  Let’s take a look at this claim’s truthfulness. When asked to support the claim, Hovde spokesman Zach Bannon pointed to a proposed amendment to the fiscal year 2021 budget. ""When creating the FY2021 budget, which included stimulus checks to Americans suffering from COVID-19 and lockdowns, Senators (Todd) Young (R-Ind.) and (Tom) Cotton (R-Ark.) proposed an amendment ‘preventing legislation that would allow illegal immigrants to receive Economic Impact Payments or any other similar direct, tax-based temporary financial assistance,’"" Bannon said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  Bannon noted the amendment ""ensuring taxpayer dollars would not be sent to illegal immigrants,"" was supported by 58 senators, including eight Democrats.  ""Senator Baldwin was among the 42 Democrats who voted against the amendment,"" Bannon said.  According to the  U.S. Senate Roll Call  page on the measure, a vote was taken Feb. 4, 2021, and totals were 58 yes and 42 no votes, and yes, Baldwin was among the no voters.  But it is a stretch to claim voting against a measure aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving economic impact payments is the same as actually giving ""stimulus checks to illegals."" There is a long list of debunked claims related to stimulus checks going to illegal immigrants. Here is a sampling: Sept. 4, 2024:  PolitiFact rated Republican claims that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, voted to give immigrants in the country illegally stimulus checks False.   Sept. 6, 2024:  PolitiFact rated Republican claims that U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., voted to give immigrants in the country illegally stimulus checks False. May 2, 2022:  PolitiFact rated Republican claims that U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., voted to give immigrants in the country illegally stimulus checks False. April 2, 2021:  Reuters rated claims that immigrants in the country illegally were eligible for stimulus checks False.  March 17, 2021:  USA Today rated Republican claims that immigrants in the country illegally would receive stimulus checks Partly False.  Baldwin’s office pointed out that immigrants in the country illegally were not eligible for stimulus checks under the American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan required people receiving stimulus checks to have valid Social Security numbers. Michael Wagner, director of the Center for Communication and Civic Renewal and professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said voting against the Young/Cotton amendment is not tantamount to supporting ""giving stimulus checks"" to nonresident immigrants. ""Stimulus checks only went to people with a Social Security number,"" Wagner said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Some noncitizens legally employed by DHS can get a Social Security number, and a small number of people in the U.S. on legal temporary working visas may also have been eligible for stimulus checks."" Wagner said it is theoretically possible that a very small number of people overstayed their work visas and received checks, but that’s not at all close to what the ad is trying to lead voters to conclude.  ""The ad is consistent with extremist rhetoric occurring along the campaign trail from former President Trump and Mr. Hovde about immigrants to the United States,"" Wagner said.  A Hovde campaign ad features a man and woman saying Baldwin ""gave stimulus checks to illegals.""  But people in the country illegally were not eligible for the checks, and the checks went only to people with Social Security numbers.  We rate the claim False.",false,Eric Hovde,2024-09-05,2024-10-11,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP_stimulus_check_2021/7408b1fbb039695d48208e96256d5af3.jpeg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/11/eric-hovde/wisconsin-gop-challengers-ad-falsely-claims-dem-us/,"Immigration, Elections, Social Security, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Eric Hovde"
politifact,“We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half.”,"Fentanyl seizures have more than doubled under the Biden-Harris administration, federal data shows. But that doesn’t confirm that the amount of fentanyl flowing into the U.S. has been cut in half.     Fentanyl seizure data tells us only how much fentanyl was stopped from entering the U.S., not how much entered.     One drug policy expert said a rise in seizures generally signals that more fentanyl is entering the U.S. Another expert said the data could be interpreted either way: as more coming in, or as less coming in.","In the weeks leading up to the presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris touted to voters the Biden-Harris administration’s actions to stop fentanyl from entering the U.S. Fentanyl is  a potent synthetic opioid  and the primary driver of overdose deaths in the U.S., according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.  During Harris’ Oct. 7  interview  on CBS News’ ""60 Minutes,"" correspondent Bill Whitaker asked her about the immigration policies of President Joe Biden’s administration. Illegal immigration ""quadrupled under your watch,"" he said. Harris rebutted Whitaker’s assertion, saying illegal immigration has dropped.  ""Because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half,"" Harris said. She said something similar Oct. 8 on ABC’s "" The View ."" ""We have seen … the intake of fentanyl reduced by half,"" she said. Harris' presidential campaign did not provide evidence backing the claim. Drug experts said there’s no way to know with certainty whether Harris’ claim is true.  Federal  drug seizure data  shows how much fentanyl Customs and Border Protection seized (27,000 pounds in fiscal year 2023, 11,200 pounds in 2021). But it does not show how much fentanyl came into the U.S.  ""No one knows how much the flow of fentanyl has been cut because we don’t know how much has been coming in,"" Joseph Palamar, a New York University associate professor who studies drug use, drug policy and epidemiology, said. We’ve  examined  whether more drug seizures mean better interdiction or more drugs on the streets. The answer? Hard to tell, given insufficient data. The seizure data is interpreted differently by people who want to tout success and by people who want to outline failure. Some cite a rise in drug seizures as a sign of improved interdiction, others say that same number is evidence that more drugs are getting into the country. ""No change or trend in seizures permits a definitive statement about what is happening to quantities that arrive,"" Jonathan Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon University drug policy researcher said. Here’s what drug experts told us about what we can and can’t infer from the data. Most illicit fentanyl in the U.S.  comes from Mexico  made with chemicals from Chinese labs. It enters the U.S. mainly through the southern border at official ports of entry, and it’s  smuggled  in mostly by U.S. citizens.  Fentanyl seizures have been rising for the past decade.  Fiscal years start in October and end in September. In fiscal year 2015, border officials seized 70 pounds of fentanyl. In 2016, former President Barack Obama’s last year in office, CBP  seized  701 pounds. During former President Donald Trump’s first three years, officials seized an average 2,400 pounds a year; in fiscal year 2020, they seized about 4,800 pounds. Under Biden’s administration, in fiscal year 2021, officials seized 11,200 pounds; that increased to 27,000 pounds in 2023. As of August, border officials had seized 19,700 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year 2024. To know how much fentanyl is in the U.S., experts said we need to know how much fentanyl is being produced, how much is being sent here and how much is seized. ""We don’t have data on the total amount of fentanyl being produced and trafficked,"" said David Luckey, a senior international and defense researcher at Rand Corp., a global policy think tank. The only complete, available data shows how much fentanyl is seized at the border. Data on fentanyl seizures inside the U.S. is incomplete, Luckey said.  That the U.S. seizing more fentanyl could mean more of the drug is coming into the U.S., and that's why more is being seized. But it also could mean we're interdicting more and less is coming in, he said.  Caulkins said, ""We expect seizures to go up when shipments go up and to go down when shipments go down. So generally speaking, an increase in seizures is usually interpreted as circumstantial evidence that things are getting worse not better."" An Oct. 1 NPR  article  cited drug researchers saying that there is anecdotal evidence that the fentanyl supply in the U.S. may be decreasing in certain parts of the country. However, other experts cautioned that it’s unclear whether that trend will continue. Opioid overdose  deaths  also dropped in the U.S. in 2023, a disruption from a years-long upward trend. However, the overall death toll remains higher than just a few years ago,  according to KFF . It’s too soon to predict whether the downward trend will continue. But neither data point proves with certainty that the rise in seizures is evidence that fentanyl in the U.S. has been cut in half. Harris said ""We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half."" Federal data shows that fentanyl seizures have more than doubled during the Biden-Harris administration. But that doesn’t mean the amount of fentanyl entering the U.S. has been cut in half. Data to prove that statement is unavailable. Fentanyl seizure data tells us only how much fentanyl was stopped from entering the U.S. But the data doesn’t tell us how much fentanyl entered.  One drug expert said the uptick in fentanyl seizures could mean either that more is coming in or that less is coming in. Another drug policy expert said there is no way to know with certainty what a rise in seizures mean; generally it is interpreted to mean that more fentanyl is entering the U.S. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker.

politifact,North Carolina’s new voting rules in response to Hurricane Helene amount to “cheating” or “stealing.”,"The North Carolina General Assembly voted unanimously to change election rules to make in-person and mail voting easier in counties affected by Hurricane Helene.     The change in state law was similar to changes approved unanimously a day earlier by the bipartisan North Carolina State Board of Elections.     The Board of Elections has a Democratic majority; the General Assembly has a Republican majority. The changes were done publicly and apply to all voters in those counties, not just ones from one party.","After Hurricane Helene left many people in western North Carolina stranded, the state eased some rules for in-person and mail-in voting. Some social media users, however, have twisted the new rules as a plot to sway the outcome of the Nov. 5 election. ""There it is folks. … Hurricane Helene was about cheating in the Election,"" the right-leaning X account MJTruthUltra shared Oct. 9. The  post  had been viewed more than 3 million times.  Many X posts said the new rules amount to "" cheating ""  or  a plan to "" steal "" the election. That’s a distortion. There it is folks… Hurricane Helene was about cheating in the Election 🚨 The North Carolina Board of Elections Changed the Voting Rules in the Counties Affected by the Hurricane 10 Days before Early Voting Starts 🔴 RULE CHANGES • Easier access to Absentee Ballots • More…  pic.twitter.com/uEClhr2H3X The changes amount to a bipartisan effort to help people vote. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign  called on North Carolina  to expand voter access in affected counties, and some new rules mirror the campaign’s suggestions. Western North Carolina is a Republican stronghold, and  Trump won most of those counties in 2020 . Republican House Speaker Tim Moore told PolitiFact that the election rule changes ""will ensure displaced Hurricane Helene victims in the impacted counties can vote, while also providing safeguards such as requiring a bipartisan majority of the county board in order to make significant changes to early voting and initiate out of precinct/out of county voting.""  The hurricane damage poses logistical challenges for voting by mail and in person because some people are no longer living in their homes or can’t travel to certain sites. The storm left five early voting sites unusable as of Oct. 10.  ""You have poll sites that literally no longer exist,"" Moore  said . ""A fire department or church or community building — that building is no longer there."" The hurricane killed  more than 100 people  in North Carolina, and hundreds are homeless while tens of thousands have no power. Hundreds of roads  were washed out .  State officials have committed to making voting accessible despite the disaster. ""The emergency response actions were taken as a result of the most significant natural disaster to affect western North Carolina within living memory,"" said Stacy Eggers IV, a Republican state elections board member. The majority of North Carolina voters are expected to vote in person, either when early voting begins Oct. 17 or on Election Day.  ' The state Board of Elections, which includes three Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously Oct. 7 to change the rules in 13 counties affected by Hurricane Helene. State  law  gives the state board emergency powers in the event of a natural disaster.  The board voted for the rules after consulting with county election officials, public safety and emergency management officials, and the U.S. Postal Service. The board  announced the changes publicly. Two days later, the state General Assembly unanimously passed  House Bill 149 , a package of Helene response measures that included most of what the elections board approved in its resolution. It applies to the 25 counties in western North Carolina (there are 100 counties in the state). Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper signed the bill Oct. 10. The rules apply to all voters in those counties, regardless of party.  The Legislature approved an extra $5 million in funding for elections in the western part of the state, up from the elections board’s initial $2 million request. Here’s what some of the new rules do: Counties can modify early voting sites : A county board of elections, by bipartisan majority vote, can change the locations, days or hours of early voting sites. Counties can move Election Day sites : Again with a county board approval, Election Day polling places may be moved, but as close to the planned sites as possible. More time to request an absentee ballot : A voter can request an absentee ballot, or a near relative can do it on their behalf, in person at the county board of elections office up until 5 p.m. Nov. 4, the day before the election. (Usually voters fill out a form and the county must receive the application one week before the election and the county mails the ballot.) More places to return absentee ballots : Absentee ballots may be delivered in person, by a voter or that voter's near relative, by handing the voted ballot to an elections official at any county elections office or the state office. (Usually voters mail or drop off the ballots in their own county.) Expanding the pool of election workers : A qualified registered voter can be appointed to work as a judge at an election precinct or as an assistant regardless of the precinct or county where the person lives.  Eggers told PolitiFact that several safeguards remain in place.  ""No change has been made to the qualifications to vote, the voter registration process, the vote tabulation process, or voter ID requirements,"" Eggers said. Eggers said he didn’t see how someone could conclude that the bipartisan rule changes are cheating. ""It seems like an attempt to sensationalize something which is not controversial,"" Eggers said. The MJTruthUltra account warned that allowing voters to return ballots anywhere in the state, would make contesting voter turnout impossible. ""If one county has 15,000 registered voters, we could now see a 30,000 voter turnout,"" the X post said.  That’s not how it will work. The new law requires officials to document the chain of custody of any ballots that move from county to county. ""Despite the false narrative, absentee ballots returned out of county are tracked back to the precinct and county where the voter is registered,"" Moore said. Michael Bitzer, a politics and history professor at Catawba College, wrote an  analysis  of party registration for the 1.3 million voters in the 25 counties. He found that Democrats are 23% of the voters while the majority are Republicans and unaffiliated voters.  Posts on X said that North Carolina’s new voting rules in response to Hurricane Helene amount to ""cheating"" or a plot to ""steal"" the election. The rule changes were legal, made in the open, and designed to help people in affected areas overcome voting obstacles. It’s a rare example of how politicians and officials can coalesce quickly to help voters, regardless of party, cast a ballot in person or by mail, despite widespread damage to their communities. Trump's campaign requested some of the changes. Without the new rules, some voters may have not been able to cast a ballot. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

politifact,Vice President Kamala Harris’ “60 Minutes” interview may be “a major Campaign Finance Violation.”,"Political experts told PolitiFact the argument that Vice President Kamala Harris’ ""60 minutes"" interview violated campaign finance laws is far-fetched and baseless.     A video clip previewing Harris’ interview and the full aired interview showed different responses from Harris on a question about U.S.-Israel relations. But a media ethics expert said it’s common for broadcast news outlets to edit interviews this way because of time constraints.","After former President Donald Trump backed out of a ""60 Minutes"" interview — skipping a decadeslong tradition of major party presidential candidates’ interviews with the network ahead of the general election — he called his Democratic opponent’s interview a ""giant fake news scam."" Before Vice President Kamala Harris’ ""60 minutes"" interview aired, the show  posted  a video clip preview Oct. 6 on X. The CBS News show ""Face the Nation"" also  shared  the preview during its Oct. 6 broadcast. In the clip, Harris answered a question about U.S.-Israel relations. The next day, when the full interview aired, it showed Harris giving a different answer to the same question. ""I’ve never seen this before, but the producers of 60 Minutes sliced and diced (‘cut and pasted’) Lyin’ Kamala’s answers to questions … all in an effort, possibly illegal as part of the ‘News Division,’ which must be licensed, to make her look ‘more Presidential,’ or a least, better,"" Trump  posted  Oct. 9 on Truth Social. He continued, ""It may also be a major Campaign Finance Violation."" PolitiFact contacted Trump’s campaign to clarify what campaign finance rule he was referring to, but spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not answer that question. Instead, she called on CBS News to release the ""full, unedited transcript"" from Harris’ ""60 Minutes"" interview. ""What do they, and Kamala, have to hide?"" Leavitt said. A media ethics expert told us it’s common for television broadcasts to select portions of a response from an interview, but that the network should publicly clarify its actions. And campaign finance experts said Trump’s claim about a rule violation is baseless.  In the  preview   clip  and the  full interview , ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker asked about the Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Here is the exchange from the preview clip: Whitaker:  ""We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a cease-fire. He’s resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway. He has promised to make Iran pay for the missile attack, and that has the potential of expanding the war. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" Harris:  ""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah, presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. Now, the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a cease-fire. And we’re not gonna stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region including Arab leaders."" Whitaker:  ""But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening."" Harris:  ""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region."" Whitaker:  ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" Harris:  ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is, ‘Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people’? And the answer to that question is, ‘Yes.’"" And here’s the exchange on the same topic that was included in the full interview: Whitaker:  ""We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a cease-fire. He's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway.

Whitaker:  ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" Harris:  ""I think, with all due respect, the better question is, ‘Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people’? And the answer to that question is, ‘Yes.’"" Trump and other  social   media   users  shared a side-by-side comparison of Harris’ different responses to Whitaker’s remark about Netanyahu ""not listening."" Trump  posted  Oct. 10 on Truth Social that Harris’ ""REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better."" But that’s not what CBS News says happened, The Associated Press  reported . (PolitiFact contacted CBS News, but received no reply.) A CBS News spokesperson told The Associated Press that Harris said both of the statements seen in the preview clip and the full interview back-to-back during her sit-down with ""60 Minutes."" The full interview took 45 minutes, and that was edited down to 20-minutes. CBS News did not respond on the record to the AP about Trump’s criticisms. Kelly McBride, senior vice president and chair of Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, told PolitiFact that this type of editing is typical for broadcast news. (PolitiFact is owned by the Poynter Institute.) ""It is a time-limited medium, so they’re definitely going to select portions of a response in an interview,"" McBride said. She added that some broadcast news outlets have standards against jumping clips together or removing presidential candidates’ stumbles. McBride said although she is not privy to the details of what happened with this ""60 Minutes"" interview, in most cases, broadcast news outlets are editing ""to make the production more digestible for the audience, not to deceive, by either making a candidate look better or worse."" But because CBS News hasn’t released the unedited, full interview with Harris, Trump has been able to question the outlet’s journalistic integrity, McBride said. ""Once you cast doubt on something, it’s really on the news organization to explain and demonstrate why it’s trustworthy, and that shouldn’t be hard to do,"" McBride said. In his criticism of Harris’ ""60 Minutes"" interview, Trump claimed campaign finance rules might have been broken. Absent details or evidence from the Trump team, political experts we contacted said they did not believe that this interview was a campaign finance violation. Some  social media   users  claimed the interview was edited to favor Harris and that amounted to an ""in-kind contribution."" This type of contribution is a nonmonetary donation to a political candidate, such as when an organization offers a candidate goods or services for free or at a discounted rate, according to the  Federal Election Commission . But Dan Weiner, director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s elections and government program, said it’s a ""pretty far-fetched argument."" ""I’m not aware of the FEC or any other governmental body concluding that (news) coverage that some people might have thought was favorable amounted to an in-kind contribution,"" Weiner said. ""This is pretty far afield from anything that I think the FEC or any other regulatory body would ever pursue."" Weiner added that social media users could be referring to the Federal Election Commission’s  rule  that public debates must be structured so that they do not promote or advance one candidate over another. If a debate is slanted toward one candidate, that ""might constitute an illegal contribution,"" he said. McBride, of Poynter, said, ""When I look at the tapes, I don’t think (Harris) comes off looking any better in either one. I can’t discern a nefarious motive by looking at the two different tapes."" Trump said on Truth Social that Harris’ ""60 minutes"" interview might be ""a major Campaign Finance Violation.""

A staff member’s Oct. 1 email said the flooding’s full impact was unfolding and that people urgently needed medical and hygiene supplies along with food, water and temporary shelter. ""We are coordinating all disaster response efforts through the Governor’s office, and they have asked us to spread the following message: Please do NOT travel to western NC to deliver donations, volunteer spontaneously, bring home cooked meals, or view the devastation. The roads are impassable, and rescue and recovery operations are ongoing."" The email also encouraged employees to make donations or volunteer with agencies designated to coordinate relief efforts. A different employee sent a Sept. 30 email that said ""the urgent needs of these communities ignite a desire to help in all of us.""  ""We are following the governor’s office’s coordination in a statewide response. Blue Cross NC is working with state, federal, local officials and our community partners across western NC counties to assess the needs of our communities and determine how we can best support them."" Also on Sept. 30, the state’s Transportation Department  discouraged  all nonemergency travel to western North Carolina because   hundreds of roads  remained impassable there. Using those emails, the National File concluded that Blue Cross ""intentionally worked to slow down the Helene response in western North Carolina.""  But the emails do not prove that. They show the company wanted to ensure that their employees didn’t drive on dangerous roads and offered them several ways to help victims. The article did not quote any government officials or nonprofits assisting with rescue or recovery. It is common for government officials to urge people to avoid damaged areas in the aftermath of a disaster amid rescue efforts. A Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina spokesperson provided a statement from the company that called the National File story ""not only false, the entire premise is outrageous.""  ""We are a North Carolina based not-for-profit that exists to serve our fellow North Carolinians — and that is exactly what we have done for the past two weeks,"" the statement said. ""We are working with a wide range of relief organizations including the United Way, the Community Foundation of Western North Carolina, Samaritan’s Purse, the American Red Cross, and many others. It’s a shame that some choose to share this disinformation when so many North Carolinians are suffering."" Blue Cross announced a  $2.5 million  donation to hurricane relief and said it has delivered more than 60,000 items — including water, diapers, wipes, and gloves — to western North Carolina since Oct. 4. Blue Cross is also supporting faith-based organizations who are providing direct aid.  President Joe Biden listens to Gov. Roy Cooper, D-N.C., on Oct. 2, 2024, as he visits the emergency operations center in Raleigh, North Carolina, for a briefing on damage from Hurricane Helene. (AP) Rescue and relief efforts were well underway by the time Blue Cross Blue Shield workers emailed guidance. In a Sept. 29  news release , Cooper announced: Power had been restored to more than 500,000 North Carolina customers. Five hundred fifty members of the North Carolina National Guard had deployed, along with more than 100 vehicles and 11 aircraft. Twenty-four shelters had opened to up to 942 victims State search and rescue teams have conducted hundreds of rescues. More than 1,600 North Carolina Department of Transportation employees and contract crews were working to clear and reopen roads. The federal government had granted Cooper’s request for a Federal Major Disaster Declaration, helping 25 counties and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. That same day, Cooper’s office encouraged people to  donate to the state’s disaster relief fund , which the United Way of North Carolina manages.  By Oct. 1, more volunteers and rescue teams were on the ground and in the air in western North Carolina. Cooper was  on the ground that day , too, surveying damage. That day, 35 National Guard helicopters were engaged in response missions, including Chinooks for delivering essential supplies and Blackhawks and Lakotas for rescue and recovery efforts, said Jody Donaldson, North Carolina Department of Public Safety communications officer. ""Moreover, we're supported by a large fleet of FEMA air assets, providing comprehensive aerial coverage to aid in the ongoing response and recovery efforts,"" Donaldson told PolitiFact on Oct. 1 in response to a different inquiry. Cooper signed a $273 million Helene relief package  Oct. 10, a day after the GOP-led state Legislature passed it unanimously. The package includes money for public schools, the state Board of Elections and regional governments in storm-affected counties and helps the state match federal government relief money.  The federal response has been robust. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said  as of Oct. 11 , federal disaster assistance for survivors of Hurricane Helene In North Carolina included: More than $71.7 million in housing and other types of assistance for over 52,000 households. Search-and-rescue personnel had rescued or supported over 3,200 survivors. More than 1,600 families are in a transitional shelter program.  Biden  declared  a federal disaster in North Carolina on Sept. 28, which then made federal funding available.  Biden approved a 100% federal cost-share  for North Carolina and other states to help those states’ response efforts. The U.S. Transportation Department said Oct. 5 that it was giving $100 million to North Carolina to repair  roads . The majority of western North Carolina counties  voted for Trump in 2020 .  Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C ., said that while FEMA’s response ""has had its shortfalls"" the federal government has not prevented supplies or donations or rescue efforts from reaching western North Carolina. Trump said, ""It has just come out that Democrats in Washington and the Democrat Governor’s Office of North Carolina (Roy Cooper) were blocking people and money from coming into North Carolina."" There is room for legitimate discussion about the pace and scope of the government response, and how it could be improved. However, it is entirely different to claim Democrats, including the state’s governor, were ""blocking"" assistance.  In our search for anything that might support Trump’s statement, we found an article from a right-wing website that misconstrued internal emails from Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. The employees cited Cooper’s office and urged colleagues who wanted to help after the storm not to travel to the state’s western region, as roads were impassable there and rescue operations were underway. Those emails did not show Cooper blocking aid; they explained how workers could donate.

The claim also went viral on X. Users there  shared  a video of 12 buses from Yankee Line, a charter bus company, leaving Harris’ Sept. 4 event and said it was  proof  that Harris was busing people to the rally from Massachusetts. The evidence that Bongino provided for his claim that the Harris’ campaign was busing people to the rally was the CBS reporter saying attendees were leaving the rally on shuttles. But the buses were used only to transport people to the rally from a parking lot a few miles away.

politifact,Says former President Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election.,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, for several weeks avoided directly answering questions about whether Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, pivoting to the topic of censorship.     Joe Biden won 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232. States certified the results, and Congress accepted the results showing that Biden won.     Republican officials in Trump’s administration and battlegrounds said the 2020 election was safe and secure.","After weeks of avoiding a direct answer to the question of whether former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, finally got definitive.  But it was a false answer. At an Oct. 16 event in Pennsylvania, a  reporter asked Vance , ""What message do you think it sends to independent voters when you do not directly answer the question, ‘Did Donald Trump lose in 2020?’""  The question drew boos from the crowd before Vance responded: ""On the election of 2020, I have answered this question directly a million times: No. I think there were serious problems in 2020. So, did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use, OK? I really couldn't care less if you agree or disagree with me on this issue."" Vance said that the media ""will focus on court cases"" or a ""crazy conspiracy theory."" When rival vice presidential nominee Tim Walz asked Vance at the Oct. 1 debate whether Trump had lost the 2020 election, Vance said, ""I’m focused on the future,"" and then  focused on censorship . In a  New York Times interview , Vance repeatedly would not answer questions about whether Trump lost but said he would have voted against certifying the results. Politicians are free to air concerns about elections, but whether Trump won or lost is not about word choice or opinion. Here is how we know Trump lost. Biden earned his victory by winning more votes in the Electoral College.  Biden received 306 electoral votes  compared with 232 for Trump. Biden’s path to victory included the battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Although the popular vote doesn't determine who wins presidential elections, Biden received about 7 million more votes nationwide than Trump. The 2020 election’s outcome was verified in many ways: States certified the results.  Trump and his allies lost  more than 60 lawsuits .  Congress accepted the results on Jan. 6, 2021, after a  violent riot  at the U.S. Capitol. A group of conservatives, including former federal judges, examined every fraud and miscount claim by Trump and  concluded  that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results.""  Republicans in Trump’s own administration, including his then-attorney general,  Bill Barr , told Trump his statements about the ""stolen"" election were ""bull—-.""  Republican state election officials  including in Georgia said that the election was secure that Biden was the winner. Ken Block, a former Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate who founded Simpatico Software Systems, wrote a  USA Today op-ed  explaining how the Trump campaign hired him to try to back up Trump’s postelection allegations. But he did not find what Trump wanted. ""What these claims don’t take into account is that voter fraud is detectable, quantifiable and verifiable,"" Block wrote in USA Today. ""I have yet to see anyone offer up ‘evidence’ of voter fraud from the 2020 election that provides these three things."" PolitiFact has  documented some examples of voter fraud in 2020 , such as people casting votes on dead relatives’ behalf. But these instances were not enough to change the race’s outcome, and Republicans committed  some voter crimes .  We did not hear back from the Trump-Vance campaign, but the Republican National Committee  sent PolitiFact  news articles after the debate related to Vance’s statement about the Biden White House engaging in censorship.  ""Censorship"" commentary intensified in August when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress that the Biden administration has pressured the company to censor some posts as part of the company’s content moderation. But  experts have told PolitiFact  that such pressure doesn’t amount to censorship, and the Supreme Court ruled in Biden’s favor in a lawsuit on the topic. The Trump administration similarly asked Twitter to remove some posts. Zuckerberg wrote in a letter to a House committee that ultimately it was the company’s decision whether to remove content, but that ""the government pressure was wrong"" and he regretted not speaking up about it then. One Meta decision Zuckerberg cited — to temporarily demote an October 2020 New York Post  story  about Hunter Biden’s laptop after an FBI warning about a potential Russian disinformation operation — happened when Trump was in office and running again for president. Justin Grimmer, a Stanford University political science professor who concluded claims about voter fraud  lacked evidence,  said that tech companies did stop citizens from sharing information about the Hunter Biden laptop story, which he views as a ""blunder.""  ""However, this activity does not invalidate an election nor would it be legal grounds for objecting to an election,"" Grimmer said. ""Similarly, I think it is unfortunate that the Russians hacked the Clinton campaign's email server in 2016. But, it is preposterous to suggest that hacking would invalidate Trump's victory. "" When asked whether Trump lost the 2020 election, Vance said ""no."" He added, ""Did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use, OK?"" Determining a presidential election’s winner and loser is not about word choice. The 2020 election was one of the most scrutinized and litigated in history. Biden won enough electoral votes to win the election. Vance can wish Trump won the election, but he didn’t. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

politifact,Screenshots of documents show a former student of Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz has lodged sexual abuse allegations against him.,"An X account shared screenshots of a supposed former student’s emails. But the documents contained multiple inconsistencies, including the email layouts and date formatting, undermining their credibility.     The X account also manipulated facts about Democratic vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s life and career, pulled from public records and news reports, to build this baseless narrative.     The X user offered no verifiable evidence to support this allegation.","With Election Day just weeks away, a pro-Donald Trump X account claimed to have insider knowledge that Democratic vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had ""an inappropriate relationship with a minor"" when he was a public schoolteacher. The X account, which posts under the username @DocNetyoutube and goes by the name ""Black Insurrectionist,"" is known for spreading unsubstantiated claims. In September, the X account  elevated the unverified account  that an ABC News whistleblower had said the network conspired with Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to set up the presidential debate in Harris’s favor. On Oct. 13, Black Insurrectionist posted that an unnamed, male former Walz student had contacted the X account in August, alleging Walz had sexually abused him in the 1990s when he was a student at Alliance High School in Nebraska. Through more than 20 posts shared over almost 48 hours, Black Insurrectionist built the narrative around this allegation. But much of the purported evidence contained inconsistencies and inaccuracies. And the X account never offered verifiable proof to support the claim. Still, some of Black Insurrectionist’s X posts about Walz were viewed millions of times. And this baseless story has spread to other social media platforms, including  Facebook ,  Instagram ,  Threads   and   TikTok . The Facebook, Instagram and Threads posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) TikTok also identified video of the claim as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's  partnership with TikTok .) Earlier this month, Walz was the subject of a similar unsubstantiated allegation that he ""groomed"" a foreign exchange student from Kazakhstan. NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation,  debunked the claim , finding that a Russian disinformation operative was pushing it. McKenzie Sadeghi, NewsGuard’s artificial intelligence and foreign influence editor, told PolitiFact, ""DocNetYouTube played a key role in promoting the false Kazakhstan former exchange student narrative and distributing it to a larger audience."" PolitiFact contacted the Harris-Walz campaign, but a spokesperson declined to comment. Black Insurrectionist’s first Oct. 13 post  announcing  its email correspondence with the former student included screenshots of the supposed emails. But formatting inconsistencies undermined the emails’ authenticity. For example, Black Insurrectionist  shared  side-by-side screenshots supposedly showing the former student’s initial email and the X account’s response. Although Black Insurrectionist’s email appeared to be sent using Proton Mail, an email service with end-to-end encryption, the picture of the former student’s email did not match Proton Mail’s layout. The account  posted  that it used Proton Mail, Yahoo Mail and Rocketmail, but none of the former student’s email screenshots matched those layouts either. (Screenshots from X and Proton Mail) Screenshots of the former student’s emails also showed inconsistent date formatting. For example, the first email’s date had a leading zero in the day number, whereas the other two dates showed single digits only. The second email also lacked a comma after the day of the week. (Screenshots from X) Additionally, Black Insurrectionist’s screenshot of the former student’s Aug. 9 email showed a cursor, indicating the email may have been forged. (Screenshot from X) Black Insurrectionist  wrote  in an Oct. 13 post that it contacted the Harris-Walz campaign before releasing details about this allegation. ""I was trying to give them every chance in the world,"" the X user wrote. In that post, the user shared a screen recording of a message being typed and sent through the  Harris-Walz campaign website . The typed message included the date ""8-23-24."" No other date was visible in the recording. But PolitiFact found a discrepancy with the date Black Insurrectionist said it contacted the Harris-Walz campaign. The campaign website’s design seen in the screen recording doesn’t match how the website looked Aug. 23, according to an  archived version  of the site. An Aug. 23  archive  of the campaign website’s contact page showed a red ""Submit"" button and navy banner at the top of the page. But the screen recording showed a blue ""Submit"" button and a bright blue banner with the words ""Contact Us"" at the top of the page, as it  did Oct. 17 , when last we looked. Sometime between  Sept. 11  and  Sept. 13 , the campaign website was updated, changing certain design elements and colors. This means the X account’s message was recorded after mid-September, and not in August like it said. (Screenshots from the Harris-Walz campaign website) To build the narrative around this allegation, Black Insurrectionist also manipulated facts about Walz’s life and career, pulling from information in public records and news reports. For example, the X user  wrote  Oct. 13 that the former student said Walz took him to an Indigo Girls concert in Nebraska in March 1995. In a subsequent post, the X user  wrote  that the former student said Walz sexually abused him after the concert. Months earlier, on Aug. 20, The New York Times  published  a story about Walz’s efforts to support gay students as his high school’s gay-straight alliance adviser. The article included an anecdote about Walz and his wife, Gwen, who was also a public schoolteacher in Nebraska, taking a gay student to an Indigo Girls concert in the 1990s. The article did not say exactly when or where the concert was held. Black Insurrectionist  claimed  this story ""dropped"" because the Harris-Walz campaign was ""trying to get out in front of"" the allegations the account was sharing. The X account  wrote  in another Oct. 13 post that the board overseeing Alliance Public Schools in Nebraska, where the Walzes taught, ""voted 6-0 to fire Tim Walz."" In two  subsequent   posts , Black Insurrectionist shared screenshots of March and July 1996 board meeting minutes as purported proof. But the meeting minutes do not support the X account’s claim. The documents, which PolitiFact obtained from Alliance Public Schools’ superintendent, show the school board unanimously approved Walz’s professional leave request in March 1996. Then, four months later, in July 1996, the board accepted Tim and Gwen Walz’s resignations from their teaching and coaching positions at Alliance Public Schools. In their resignation letters, included in the meeting minutes, the Walzes wrote that they were resigning because they had accepted teaching positions at Mankato West High School in Minnesota. The former student’s account shared by this X user also included personal details about Walz in an attempt to corroborate the allegation. But these details do not lend credibility, as some of them are factually inaccurate or were already public knowledge. For instance, one of the posts mentioned Walz had a ""hearing problem."" It’s been  widely   reported  that Walz suffered hearing loss from decades in the military. Walz underwent corrective surgery in 2005 to improve his condition. Also, the former student supposedly said Walz said he served in the Persian Gulf War, an international conflict in the early 1990s triggered by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. But that’s wrong. Although Walz served in the Nebraska National Guard then, he was not deployed for that war. Walz’s  sole military deployment  came a decade later. He and his Minnesota National Guard unit were sent to Italy to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. An X account called Black Insurrectionist claimed screenshots show one of Walz’s former students lodged sexual abuse allegations against Walz. But the screenshots’ formatting inconsistencies reveal these documents are fabricated. The X account also mischaracterized details from Walz’s life and career to build the narrative around the allegations. These details do not corroborate the claim, nor does the X account provide verifiable evidence.

politifact,"Detroit’s Oct.15, 2024, absentee ballot return rate proves election fraud.","Detroit reported a 41% absentee ballot return rate as of Oct. 15. That’s compared with a 26% return rate during the same period in 2020.     Experts told PolitiFact this is not a sign of election fraud. The return rate might be influenced by Michigan’s expanded access for absentee voting, greater voter awareness of and confidence in that method and voters’ enthusiasm for candidates and measures on the ballot.     Statewide, Michigan has seen a lower absentee ballot return rate so far this year compared with 2020. As of Oct. 15, 31% of Michiganders had returned their ballots, compared with 34% at the same time in 2020. That year, Michigan issued absentee ballot applications to all registered voters as part of its COVID-19 response.","Detroit was a 2020 target of election misinformation, and now that early voting is underway around the country, social media users have been closely monitoring the city’s voting activity. Some users have baselessly claimed that — three weeks before Election Day — there’s already evidence of fraud. ""Detroit is the worst-run city in the US but already hit (an absentee) ballot return rate of 40%,"" the conservative X account End Wokeness wrote in an  Oct. 14 X post . The conservative account Hodgetwins  reposted that Oct. 15  with the caption, ""They are stealing Michigan already."" (Screenshot from X) As of Oct. 15, Detroit had issued 100,470 ballots and received 41,235 — a 41% return rate. That’s compared with the last general election, when by Oct. 12, 2020, Detroit had issued 132,879 ballots and received 34,735, a 26% return rate. The Michigan Department of State issued figures per jurisdiction for absentee ballot requests, ballots issued and ballots received. PolitiFact calculated the return rates by dividing the number of ballots received by the number of ballots issued. Experts told PolitiFact this higher return rate is not evidence of election fraud. They said the return rate is not surprising and is likely caused by multiple factors, including expanded access to absentee voting, greater awareness and enthusiasm among voters to cast ballots for or against candidates or measures. Matt Friedman, spokesperson for the nonpartisan voter information campaign program Detroit Votes, who is authorized to speak on behalf of the Detroit City Clerk’s Office, said the city has been reminding voters to submit their ballots early. One city  newsletter  said, ""It’s critical for Detroit voters who received absentee ballots to return them as soon as possible. The Department of Elections anticipates a high volume of absentee ballots to be processed for the Presidential Election."" He also pointed to an increase in the number of drop boxes in Detroit. There are now  35 locations , compared with  30  in 2020.  Friedman also said technology for accepting absentee ballots has been upgraded through a system called Relia-Vote, which allows for  faster processing  of absentee ballots.  ""The system is working as intended,"" Friedman said. The Michigan Department of State said that statewide,  as of Oct. 15 , more than 2.1 million registered voters requested an absentee ballot. More than 672,000 ballots have been received, for a 32% return rate. PolitiFact calculated this return rate by dividing the number of ballots received by the number of ballots requested. Using the same metrics, the return rate was higher at the same time in 2020, when 34% of absentee voters had returned their absentee ballots. Paul Manson, research director at the Election & Voting Information Center, a nonpartisan academic research center, said that in 2020, Michigan  issued absentee ballot applications  to all registered voters as part of its COVID-19 response. ""This year if the voter was not on the permanent absentee list they would need to take more steps"" to receive an absentee ballot, he said. ""So this likely skews the denominator"" between 2020 and 2024. Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote At Home Institute, an organization advocating for increased access to and confidence in vote-by-mail systems, said voters are now ""much more familiar with mail ballots and voting at home."" Michigan implemented ""no-reason"" absentee voting in  2018 ; this is the second general election for which Michigan voters can request absentee ballots without providing a reason. Before 2018, Michigan voters could request absentee ballots only if they met  one of six criteria , such as being at least 60 years old or being in jail awaiting trial. Michigan voters passed  Proposal 2  in 2022, which expanded early voting and absentee voting rights. Voters can now apply for the permanent absent voter list and receive absentee ballots for every future election.  The University of Florida Election Lab  early vote dashboard  shows that 25 Michigan counties reported absentee ballot return rates higher than 40% as of Oct. 16. Wayne County, where Detroit is, reported a 39% return rate. Return rates higher than 2020 might reflect Michigan’s voting changes, Paul Gronke, director of the Elections and Voting Information Center, said. ""But it is not evidence at all of an election being ‘stolen,’"" Gronke said. ""In (fact), those ‘early’ reports of absentee ballot returns would be a foolish way to try to steal an election since the whole process is transparent to outside observers."" Gronke said ballot return rates may also signal enthusiasm to vote for or against candidates, contests or ballot measures. Tammy Patrick, chief program officer of the National Association of Election Officials, also known as the Election Center, said that in 2020, a shift in voting behavior showed voters took early action, ""with more early requests and returns than had been the historical trend."" ""It does not surprise me, nor cause me any concern, that voters are taking early action again in 2024,"" Patrick said. An X post said Detroit’s 2024 absentee ballot return rate is evidence of election fraud. Detroit has reported a 41% absentee ballot return rate as of Oct. 15, compared with 26% at the same time in 2020. Experts say this is not proof of fraud. Detroit made multiple efforts to improve the absentee voting systems, including increasing the number of drop box locations, reminding absentee voters to submit their ballots early and upgrading technology for processing absentee ballots. New Michigan election laws have made absentee voting more accessible since 2022.

Nelson Mandela was ""trying to come to the United States. The United States government wasn't helping him. No one was helping him,"" Murdoch  said  in an interview with Trump posted Oct. 18 on X. ""You chartered a 727 plane for their entire trip. … Why is it hard for you to talk about the things you've done?""  Mandela, who died in 2013, was an anti-apartheid activist who spent 27 years in prison before becoming South Africa’s first Black president in 1994. Trump thanked Murdoch for bringing up the story.  ""I love doing it. I don't need praise for it. We all like a certain level of praise, but I just like helping people,"" Trump said. ""I help a lot of people, and I enjoy doing it, and I never talk about it. It's nice that you bring it up. I also think it's not a narrative that the press likes talking about for me.""

Other social media users have continued to share it.  ""In 1990, President Trump chartered a private plane to get Nelson Mandela to America when the U.S. government wouldn't help,"" one Oct. 18 Instagram  post  said.  The Instagram post’s caption said Trump ""doesn’t go around bragging about his good deeds and charitable donations, but there are endless such stories."" The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about  our partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Mandela used one of Trump’s planes to fly within the U.S. But the travel wasn’t part of Trump’s ""charitable donations,"" as the Instagram post claimed. It was a $130,000 business transaction. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  In June 1990, Mandela traveled to the U.S. on an 11-day  tour  after his release from prison. Mandela visited the U.S. as part of a  larger world tour  seeking financial and political support for his party and pressuring countries to continue sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid government. Mandela’s team had four weeks to organize the tour, The New York Times  reported  at the time. A June 1990 Los Angeles Times  article  said Mandela had unsuccessfully tried to find a plane after negotiating with the U.S. government and private charter companies.  Christine Dolan, who handled Mandela’s travel logistics, told the Los Angeles Times that Mandela’s team contacted Trump asking to rent his private jet. Trump said the jet was being serviced but he offered one of his Boeing 727 commercial planes. Trump then owned an airline, Trump Shuttle, that operated flights between New York City, Washington, D.C., and Boston.  ""The Mandela Welcoming Committee is very thankful to Donald Trump,"" Dolan told the Los Angeles Times. But use of the plane wasn't free. Mandela’s team  rented a Trump Shuttle plane  for $130,000, Dolan told the newspaper.  Soon after its 1989 launch, Trump Shuttle ran into financial problems. Trump spent $365 million on 21 planes, airline terminals and equipment, according to  The Boston Globe , and also spent $1 million per plane to remodel them.  But after 18 months, The Boston Globe wrote, the company had lost $128 million. After missing a $1.1 million interest payment, Trump asked  his lenders to defer future payments, the newspaper reported. The lenders took control of the business, Time  reported , and in December 1991, they made a deal with USAir to take over Trump Shuttle,  The New York Times  reported. ""Trump obviously could not donate a plane, but he was able to free up one of the planes from Trump Shuttle,"" Dolan told  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  in June 1990, referring to Trump Shuttle’s financial troubles.  Although the Los Angeles Times reported that negotiations with the U.S. government for a plane failed, federal and local government agencies helped Mandela with U.S. travel logistics.  The State Department also provided security for Mandela, The New York Times  reported . ""Although Mr. Mandela and his wife, Winnie, are visiting the United States as private citizens, the U.S. government is picking up part of the tab,"" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  reported  in June 1990. The U.S. government provided a military jet to transport a bulletproof limousine from Washington, D.C., to Boston, the newspaper said. In New York City, the police department built a bullet- and rocket-resistant parade vehicle, a June 20, 1990, a CBS News  report  said. Around 12,000 police officers were on duty the day of Mandela’s visit to New York City, which cost $2 million in overtime that the U.S. State Department paid, CBS News said. A State Department official traveled with Mandela during his U.S. tour, the Los Angeles Times  reported .  An Instagram post said that as part of his ""charitable donations,"" in 1990 Trump ""chartered a private plane to get Nelson Mandela to America when the U.S. government wouldn't help."" Mandela used one of Trump Shuttle’s Boeing 727 planes to travel within the U.S. during his 11-day tour in June 1990. But Mandela’s team paid Trump $130,000 for use of the plane, it wasn’t a gift.  Although the U.S. government didn’t provide Mandela a plane for his U.S. travel, it paid for his security and used a military plane to transport a bulletproof limousine across states.  We rate it False.

politifact,A pro-Kamala Harris website shows she supports a mandatory gun buyback program.,,"Did you just get catfished by a political ad? If you have been scrolling on Facebook or Instagram lately, maybe.  A group called ""Progress 2028"" has paid for  Facebook and Instagram ads  that give the impression that they’re promoting Vice President Kamala Harris’ agenda on polarizing issues, including immigration, gun control and hydraulic fracturing aka fracking. But the Harris campaign isn’t behind the ads, and they distort her platform. ""Did you know?"" one  ad reads, alongside  a picture of Harris smiling and holding a microphone. ""A national, mandatory buy-back program means fewer guns & fewer tragedies. Kamala Harris gets it!"" The same ad promotes Harris’ biography ""as the daughter of immigrants."" ""Let’s get ready for the next phase in Kamala’s bold progressive agenda!"" it says before inviting viewers to ""learn about her plan"" by clicking on a blue button that redirects them to the website,  progress2028.com .  The fifth bullet on that site claims: ""Kamala Harris is dedicated to making communities safer by reducing the number of firearms in civilian hands through a fair and effective mandatory buy-back program.""  Local police departments organize gun buyback programs to encourage people to voluntarily turn over their guns in exchange for something, such as gift cards. When President Donald Trump claimed that Harris ""supports mandatory gun confiscation,"" we rated it  Mostly False . The claim contained an element of truth about her past position on assault weapons, but it left a misleading impression about her 2024 platform.  During a 2019 gun control forum in Las Vegas, when Harris was running for president, she  said , ""I support a mandatory gun buyback program"" for assault weapons.  But we found no evidence that she supports a mandatory buyback program now in her 2024 campaign, for assault weapons or any other weapon.  The Harris campaign did not provide comments for this fact-check. It told  The New York Times  in July that Harris supports banning assault weapons, but not requiring their sale to the federal government. As vice president, Harris has  urged states to pass red flag laws  and supported federal legislation that included funding for mental health and school security resources. In a Sept. 19 interview with  Oprah Winfrey , Harris said, ""I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I'm in favor of assault weapons bans, universal background checks, red flag laws."" Harris also said she was a gun owner. But she did not say there should be mandatory buyback programs. Camouflaged as a pro-Harris-Walz campaign website, the Progress 2028 website consists of two webpages — one is about its privacy policy and the other contains about 1,200 words devoted to what it claims reflects the kind of ""sweeping reforms that will ensure that equity across every corner of America,"" should Harris be elected.  Adopting the kind of phrasing Democrats might use, the webpage lays out seven ""policies,"" refers to assault weapons as ""dangerous"" and calls for ""common-sense gun reform that respects the rights of responsible owners."" It includes what it says are Harris’ stances for ""banning fracking"" and ensuring that LGBTQ+ youth have access to gender-affirming care ""without fear of discrimination or parental intervention.""   At the end of the policies page, it says ""Paid for by Progress 2028."" The site doesn’t specify who’s behind it. But there are clues it’s not Harris: Harris in 2024 said she does not support a  ban on fracking . Although she supports access to gender-affirming care, she has not said she believes parents should not be involved. OpenSecrets , a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that tracks money in politics, found the group behind Progress 2028 is the conservative nonprofit  Building America’s Future . Virginia’s State Corporation Commision shows  Building America’s Future  registered "" Progress 2028 "" in late September as a "" fictitious name ,"" which is an alternative name that a corporation can use other than its legal name.  The New York Times  reported that Building America’s Future  raised  more than $100 million over the last four years.  The name Progress 2028 alludes to  Project 2025 , a proposal for a Republican administration drafted by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from Project 2025 while the Harris campaign and her surrogates have sought to draw connections between the document and some of Trump’s policy proposals. Meta’s ad library shows that Progress 2028’s gun buyback ads are being directed to people in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all swing states in what  polls show  is a very close presidential election.  Progress 2028 claims to show a pro-Harris website promoting her support for a mandatory gun buyback program. But the website, Progress 2028, is not from her campaign or her supporters and it distorts Harris’ platform.  During Harris’ 2019 presidential campaign, she supported a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. But she no longer holds that position. She supports banning assault weapons, but not requiring buyback programs.  We rate the claim False.  PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.",false,Progress 2028,2024-10-21,2024-10-21,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/kamala_flags_10_21_2024/177bfa86622188048b24f02ee99e56ab.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/21/progress-2028/progress-2028-is-not-tied-to-kamala-harris-ads-say/,"National, Elections, Progress 2028"

PolitiFact contacted the Michigan secretary of state’s office but did not receive a reply before publication. Michigan’s Voter Information Center website  said  there were 8,441,536 registered voters in the state, as of Oct. 21. But this number doesn’t reflect how many people vote in Michigan because it includes inactive voters. For example, when election mail sent to a voter is returned as undeliverable, Michigan election officials note that the voter might have moved and send a notice of voter registration cancellation to that voter’s address. After this notice is sent, the voter is considered inactive and can still vote until their registration is canceled, the Michigan Department of State website  says . By  state and federal law , officials must cancel the inactive voter’s registration if they receive no response to the notice and the voter does not participate in the following two federal election cycles, a period that could last up to four years. People whose voter registrations are canceled may reregister. About 340,000 inactive voter registrations in Michigan are slated for cancellation in 2025, and about 258,000 inactive registrations will be canceled in 2027, according to the Voter Information Center  website .

She provided additional reasons Michigan has more registered voters than eligible voters, including: PolitiFact has  fact-checked  similar false  claims  before, and voting experts told us that outsized voter rolls do not signal fraud.

politifact,"""Reports from Whitfield County, GA that Dominion machines are flipping votes. This is exactly the kind of fraud we saw in 2020.""","Whitfield County’s Board of Elections said there were no problems with the county’s voting machines. In the case of a voter whose choices were not accurately reflected on the printed ballot, a poll worker helped the voter and the problem was resolved on-site.     The Whitfield County Board of Elections said ""no machines have been taken out of service.""","With early voting underway in many states, one elected official is resurrecting false claims from 2020 about voting machines switching votes. In an  Oct. 18 X post , Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., shared a secondhand account of a Whitfield County, Georgia, voter who said the printed version did not reflect that voter’s selections. ""Reports from Whitfield County, GA that Dominion machines are flipping votes,"" Greene wrote.  ""This is exactly the kind of fraud we saw in 2020."" A screenshot she shared showed someone making the claim that ""a family friend"" reported voting in Whitfield County, in north Georgia, and discovering that the voting machine printout didn’t reflect the voter’s correct choices.  ""After several attempts for correction they voided that ballot and machine and he had to revote on another machine!"" the message read. (Screenshot from X) Conspiracy theorist  Alex Jones  featured Greene’s claim on his show the same day, publishing a video of Greene saying she’d just heard the report. ""This is something we are just starting to look into today because I just found out about it this morning before I came on your show,"" Greene said.  ""BREAKING: MTG Investigating Reports of Votes Being Flipped In Georgia,"" The Alex Jones Show headline read. But local and state officials, as well as Dominion Voting Systems, were quick to debunk Greene’s claim that an incident in Whitfield County showed Dominion voting machines were ""flipping votes."" First,  we’ve   seen   this claim  before — in 2020. It wasn’t true then and there’s no evidence for it now. Whitfield County election officials said they knew of one reported instance in which a voter’s printed ballot did not reflect the desired choices, but it was not because the voting machine flipped the selections — and it did not represent a systemic problem involving the voting machines. ""This issue was quickly resolved while the voter was still on-site,"" the Whitfield County Board of Elections wrote Oct. 18 on its  Facebook page , reminding voters to double-check their ballots before feeding them to the scanners.  In a follow-up press release, the  Board of Elections  said the voter saw that the printed ballot did not reflect the correct choices and alerted a poll worker, who helped the voter fill out another ballot with the desired choices. Georgia allows voters to  request another ballot  if they make a mistake while filling one out.   The board said it was the only incident among more than 6,000 Whitfield County ballots cast  in person  since Oct. 15.  Shaynee Bryson, Whitfield County’s elections supervisor, told PolitiFact the incident happened because of ""user error."" She said that as of 2:30 p.m. Oct. 22, more than 10,000 voters in the county had cast their ballots ""with no issues."" Bryson said they had received no other voters’ complaints. ""We have taken no machines out of service, as we have no reason to suspect the machines are in error,"" Bryson said. She also told the  Atlanta Journal-Constitution  that no Whitfield County voter has canceled more than one ballot this year. Although Greene shared the Whitfield County Board of Elections’ press release in an  Oct. 21 X post , she did not clearly walk back her claim. PolitiFact reached out to Greene but did not receive a response. ""Anyone claiming machines are flipping votes are lying or don't research,"" Georgia Secretary of State Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling wrote on X  Oct. 18.   ""This issue is human/user error, always will be. Whitfield Co. handled it & voter voted."" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told  CBS News’ ""Face the Nation""  on Oct. 20 that the incident had been ""blown out of proportion"" on X and that it revealed no evidence of fraud. ""The equipment's working,"" Raffensperger said. ""We've done all sorts of audits, you know, since the last election and coming up to this election."" Numerous audits, investigations and lawsuits revealed there was  no widespread fraud  in the 2020 presidential election, which Joe Biden won. States certified the results. Congress accepted the results. Former President Donald Trump and his allies lost more than 60 lawsuits claiming otherwise. A group of conservatives, including former federal judges, examined every fraud and miscount claim by Trump and concluded that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results."" A monitor showing Dominion Voting Image Cast Central display tab is seen as Cobb County Election officials count ballots on a machine, Nov. 24, 2020, in Marietta, Ga. (AP) In an  Oct. 19 update  on its website, Dominion Voting said the claim that voting machines can switch votes is ""false"" and ""has been repeatedly debunked."" ""As both state and local election authorities have confirmed, the issue reported in Whitfield County was due to voter error,"" its update read. ""The county provided the voter with an opportunity to mark and print a new ballot with their correct choices and the issue was quickly resolved."" Speaking for Dominion, Penta Group Managing Director for Strategy Stephanie Walstrom told PolitiFact that 1.6 million voters in Georgia have ""successfully cast their vote with a voter-verifiable paper ballot using Dominion machines"" during early voting. Following the 2020 election, Dominion was the target of  a barrage of false  claims fueled by Trump’s supporters. They argued that the company’s voting technology had rigged the 2020 presidential election against Trump, but PolitiFact and other fact-checkers  examined many of the claims  and found them meritless. Dominion sued Fox News over defamation for endorsing, repeating, and broadcasting these falsehoods. In April 2023, Fox settled with Dominion, agreeing to pay the election technology company  $787.5 million . Fox acknowledged ""the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false."" There’s no evidence that Dominion voting machines flipped votes in Whitfield County, Georgia. And the statement that what happened at one of the county’s election sites amounted to ""the kind of fraud we saw in 2020"" is baseless; mountains of evidence show 2020 saw no widespread fraud and election officials said this case was one of user error.

politifact,Says opponent Eric Hovde “supports a $4 trillion tax plan that would disproportionately advantage the well-off and profitable corporations”,"Republican Eric Hovde, a U.S. Senate candidate in Wisconsin, has publicly supported former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut program.     That same program is projected to benefit the wealthy far more than the middle class, while raising the U.S. debt, an analysis shows.","As the race for the U.S. Senate heats up in Wisconsin, incumbent U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and challenger Republican Eric Hovde are launching attacks on each other over just about every topic.  In  an Oct. 11 interview on ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell ,"" Baldwin took aim at Hovde’s tax plan, or at least one he says he will support.  ""He supports a $4 trillion tax plan that would disproportionately advantage the well-off and profitable corporations,"" she said. ""We need to fight for tax cuts for working families,"" When we asked Baldwin’s campaign for more information, they shared a document containing a number of links to articles showing Hovde has publicly supported extending the tax cuts in the 2017 tax bill created by former President Donald Trump. According to  a Sept. 4  report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Hovde is advocating for extending Republican President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which he says puts small and medium businesses on a more even playing field with larger corporations.  The law also lowered tax rates across the board and shifted the thresholds for several income tax brackets. While the cuts reduced taxes across the board, the largest savings were seen for those in the highest income brackets.  That tax plan could add an additional $4 trillion to the U.S. debt, according to  an Oct. 7 report from NPR . The report cited an analysis by the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, which found that Trump’s tax plan would cause about $7.5 trillion of debt over the next decade, while Vice President Kamala Harris’ would add about $3.5 trillion. So that $4 trillion number comes from that analysis — the difference between the plans shared by the Trump and Harris campaigns.   As a part of that plan, Trump wants to make his tax cuts permanent, the report said.  But that doesn’t really get into who those tax cuts benefit.  According to  a June 13 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,  a nonpartisan research and policy institute, Trump’s 2017 tax cuts mostly benefited the rich. If left in place, the tax plan would leave those cuts in place.  Households with incomes in the top 1 percent received a tax cut of more than $60,000, and households in the bottom 60% will receive a $500 average tax cut in 2025, the report said.  ""As a share of after-tax income, tax cuts at the top — both for households in the top 1 percent and the top 5 percent – are more than triple the total value of the tax cuts received for people with incomes in the bottom 60 percent,"" the report said.  So, yes, the tax cuts that Hovde has publicly supported and endorsed would benefit the rich more than middle-class workers. And it’s likely that those same cuts would raise the U.S. debt, too.  A Hovde campaign spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. And  Hovde’s campaign website  doesn’t list any sort of tax plan, and he hasn’t spoken at length about a tax plan, either. Baldwin claimed that Hovde ""supports a $4 trillion tax plan that would disproportionately advantage the well-off and profitable corporations."" Hovde has publicly supported extending the 2017 tax cuts Donald Trump put in place. Research has shown that those tax cuts are more likely to benefit the ultrarich, while the middle class receives less of a benefit. This proposal isn’t new in any way — it would simply continue the status quo. And although everyone benefited from those tax cuts, the wealthy saw the biggest savings when paying their taxes, instead of low and middle-class Americans.   We rate this claim as Mostly True, meaning the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",mostly-true,Tammy Baldwin,2024-10-11,2024-10-24,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/hovde_rnc/27b010807b75ebe18c52b0e84d175315.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/24/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-claim-that-hovde-supports-tax-plan-that-be/,"Elections, Taxes, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Tammy Baldwin"

He told reporters he raised concerns to poll workers who offered him the chance to spoil his ballot and vote again. The viral posts purport that multiple people have reported the same issue with their ballots, but so far only Carpenter's account has been reported by  local   news  and addressed by election officials.  Clint Ludwig, the county’s elections administrator, said in a  video statement  published Oct. 22 that nearly 102,000 people had cast early voting ballots. Ludwig said his office did not believe the machine changed the voter’s selection and suggested that the voter had made a mistake. ""What we believe to have occurred is that the individual did make a selection on the machine and that selection was printed on their ballot,"" Ludwig, who did not mention Carpenter by name, said. ""When they went to cast their ballot, they checked it and realized that was not the vote that they wanted … He was issued a new ballot and able to vote.""  In a  separate statement , the Tarrant County elections office said it ""has no reason to believe that votes are being switched by the voting system."" The statement said it encourages voters to verify the marked choices on the printed ballot before scanning for counting. The incident has been reported to the Texas secretary of state. Tarrant County Judge Tim O’Hare, a Republican, backed the election office’s statement. ""Make sure you are careful when you are pressing your choices, make sure you review it, make sure when you print it, you thoroughly review it when you cast it,"" O’Hare said in an  interview with KXAS-TV , which covers the Dallas-Fort Worth region. ""I believe people should have confidence that votes are not being switched.""  The Texas Republican Party assured voters in  an X post  ""their votes are being accurately recorded and counted.""

Illinoisans were told they can cast their votes and they will be recorded later. It feels like we’re living in a third world country, doesn’t it?"" The video in the X post appears to feature a person explaining how votes will be processed after the scanner is fixed. A ballot scanner in Schaumburg did break down, but ballots were still processed. The videos shared on Instagram and X were originally posted by a  TikTok user . The process explained in  the video shared on X matches the protocol followed if voting machines break down in Cook County, where Schaumburg is located, about 30 miles outside Chicago. As of 2020, Schaumburg had a population of  78,723 . Frank Herrera, a Cook County clerk spokesperson, confirmed that the ballot scanner at Trickster Cultural Center, an  early voting location  in Schaumburg township, was ""temporarily down"" from about 11 a.m. on Oct. 21, but was restored by 2 p.m. the same day. He said ""voting was not affected by the issue."" ""All 760 voters who cast a ballot at Trickster had their vote counted on Monday,"" Herrera said in an email to PolitiFact. It is standard for each early voting location to have one ballot scanner, he said, and Schaumburg has several dozen polling places on Election Day.  Herrera said that the protocol for ballot scanner issues involves placing all ballots in the alternate ballot box — ""a locked box within the voter supply carrier where ballots are stored"" — until the scanner’s restoration. The ballots placed in the alternate ballot box were processed after voting concluded that day so that it didn’t interfere with in-person voting, Herrera said. Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, a nonpartisan voting rights group, said in an expert forum hosted by news organization Votebeat that ""this is the standard emergency procedure nationwide."" ""We don't want to tell voters to come back later because who knows how long it would take to fix a machine,"" Albert said. ""So instead, ballots are placed in a secure location and then scanned when the machine is working again."" The U.S. Election Assistance Commission lists backup secure ballot boxes as a  best practice  ""for storing voted ballots in case the precinct scanner is not working properly or is compromised."" This isn’t a new process for Cook County, either. The ""Scanner Troubleshooting"" section of the county clerk’s  election judge manual  for the 2022 gubernatorial general election says that in the event that the scanner is not accepting ballots and power is not the issue, ""have voters use the Alternate Ballot Box until your Scanner is fixed or replaced.""  The alternate ballot box is also used during other incidents, such as issues with printers and memory cards. Ballots are stored in the alternate ballot box only if the ballot scanner fails to take the ballots.  The man in the video’s claim that votes in the alternate ballot box would be processed when no one is around is not true, officials said. ""Once the scanner is repaired, the Alternate Ballot Box is unlocked and the ballots inside are fed through the scanner by our team of Election Judges,"" Herrera said.

Shelby County Election Administrator Linda Phillips explained what happened to two local news stations. ""There were a few voters that felt that the machine was switching their votes. That’s really not what was happening,"" Phillips  told WHBQ-TV  in Memphis. She said the issue was the placement of the voters’ fingers on the touchscreen ballot. Shelby County Election Administrator Linda Phillips in a video shows voters how to select a candidate on touchscreen machines by clicking the candidate’s name in the center of the box, not on the smaller box in the upper left corner. (Screenshot from Shelby County Election Commission X post) Phillips gave a  demonstration to WATN-TV , also in Memphis. The ballot shown on the screen has a small box on the upper left side within a larger box containing a candidate’s name. If voters use their fingers to touch the smaller box on the upper left, they could accidentally touch part of the larger box above it that has a different candidate’s name. Republican candidates’ names are listed first on the ballot, ABC 24 said. ""Whichever pressure is heavier, it’ll pick that one, and that might be the one above it,"" Phillips said. ""The real simple fix for that is either use a stylus, but the easiest way is just touch the candidate’s name.""  Similar issues have been reported in Tennessee’s Davidson and Williamson counties, according to  Nashville’s WKRN-TV . The Shelby County Election Commission  posted a video on X  Oct. 17 showing how the machines work. In the video, Phillips urges voters to aim for the center of the larger box. Phillips told PolitiFact in an Oct. 23 email that the commission has found no evidence of equipment malfunction, and the complaints about votes being swapped were limited. ""The Shelby County Election Commission has received three direct complaints at the polling sites. Of those who complained, each successfully cast their ballot for the candidates of their choice,"" Phillips said. Phillips said the commission shared voting machine demonstrations on social media, on its website and with media outlets. It has also encouraged voters to use the stylus to select candidates and urged voters to bring concerns to poll workers or request a paper ballot. An Instagram post said voting machines in Shelby County, Tennessee, are swapping votes from Harris to Trump. Election officials said there were no voting machine malfunctions. Voters had inadvertently touched the wrong area of the ballot when using the touchscreens.  The county received three complaints about the issue at polling sites; eventually, each person who had the issue cast a ballot for the candidates of their choice.

politifact,Vice President Kamala Harris has been “going so far as to call me Adolf Hitler.”,"Vice President Kamala Harris did not call former President Donald Trump ""Adolf Hitler."" In Oct. 23 comments, Harris referred to recent New York Times reporting in which former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly said Trump had said admiring things about Hitler and Hitler’s military control.     Kelly said Trump ""commented more than once that, ‘You know, Hitler did some good things, too.’"" Kelly also confirmed other reports about Trump speaking admiringly of Hitler’s military control and asking why Trump’s generals couldn’t be more like Hilter’s. Trump denied making the comments.     Harris called Trump a fascist, pointing to Trump’s public statements about an ""enemy from within"" that would cause Election Day chaos, floating the idea that the National Guard or military might be used against them.","A day after Vice President Kamala Harris called former President Donald Trump ""increasingly unhinged and unstable,"" he retorted and accused her of calling him Adolf Hitler. ""Comrade Kamala Harris sees that she is losing, and losing badly, especially after stealing the Race from Crooked Joe Biden, so now she is increasingly raising her rhetoric, going so far as to call me Adolf Hitler, and anything else that comes to her warped mind,"" the Republican presidential nominee wrote  Oct. 23 on  X  and  Truth Social . Harris did not call Trump Hitler. The Democratic presidential nominee  drew attention  to recent statements from John Kelly, a retired four-star U.S. Marine Corps general and Trump’s former chief of staff. Kelly told The New York Times in recorded interviews that Trump made admiring comments about the Nazi dictator and his control of the German military. Following the Times report,  Trump called Kelly  a ""total degenerate"" and said he ""made up a story out of pure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred."" Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump campaign spokesman, told PolitiFact that Kelly’s statements about Trump’s Hitler comments were ""absolutely false."" Under Hitler’s leadership, Nazi Germany, its allies and collaborators killed 6 million Jewish people in a state-sponsored genocide known as the  Holocaust . Hitler and his forces also persecuted and killed millions of non-Jewish people during World War II, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum. Since The New York Times  published its Oct. 22 story , Harris has referred to Kelly’s statements on a few occasions. On Oct. 23, Harris gave  brief remarks  at her Washington, D.C., residence in response to the Times’ reporting. These were her comments; we used bolded text to highlight the relevant portions: ""So, yesterday, we learned that Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four-star general, confirmed that while Donald Trump was president,  he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had. ""Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United States Constitution. He wants a military that is loyal to him. He wants a military who will be loyal to him personally, one that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the Constitution of the United States. ""In just the past week, Donald Trump has repeatedly called his fellow Americans the ‘enemy from within’ and even said that he would use the United States military to go after American citizens."" In an Oct. 13 Fox News interview, Trump  said  he believes ""the enemy from within"" would cause Election Day chaos and said that, if that happens, the National Guard or military might be used against them. Pressed on whom he identifies as ""the enemy,"" Trump has named leading  Democrats  and  others  who disagree with him. Harris made additional comments about Trump and Hitler in two Oct. 23  X   posts . She wrote: ""Donald Trump is out for unchecked power.  He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had , who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution. He is unhinged, unstable, and given a second term, there would be no one to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses.""  And, ""Donald Trump vowed to be a dictator on day one. He vowed to use the military to carry out personal and political vendettas.  His former chief of staff said he wanted generals like Hitler’s.  Trump wants unchecked power. In 13 days, the American people will decide what they want."" During her Oct. 23 CNN town hall  with host Anderson Cooper in suburban Philadelphia, Harris again referred to The New York Times report and Kelly’s remarks, saying she believed they showed that Trump is not fit to serve as president. ""John Kelly, the former chief of staff of Donald Trump, who has told us Donald Trump said, why — essentially, ‘why aren't my generals like those of Hitler's, like Hitler?’  who has referred, several times — we've heard the reports for years,"" she said. Later, when Cooper asked Harris whether she would be more pro-Israel than Trump, Harris cited the comments again:  ""I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous. I believe that, when you have a president of the United States who has said to his generals, who work for him because he is commander in chief — these conversations, I assume many of them took place in the Oval Office —  If the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, ‘Why can't you be more like Hitler's generals?’  Anderson, come on. This is a serious, serious issue.  ""The American people deserve to have a president who encourages healthy debate, works across the aisle, not afraid of good ideas wherever they come from, but also maintains certain standards about how we think about the role and the responsibility,  and certainly not comparing oneself in a clearly admiring way to Hitler."" During the town hall, Cooper asked Harris whether she thinks Trump is a fascist. The  Council on Foreign Relations  defines facism as ""a mass political movement that emphasizes extreme nationalism, militarism, and the supremacy of the nation over the individual.""  ""Yes, I do. Yes, I do,"" Harris replied. ""And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted."" Harris also said voters ""care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist."" For  its report,  The New York Times recorded three on-the-record interviews with Kelly and included interview audio clips with its article. Kelly was Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff and also served as his Homeland Security secretary. When Trump announced in December 2018 that Kelly would be leaving,  news   reports  said the men’s relationship had deteriorated. Kelly told the Times that Trump had spoken positively of Hitler: ""He commented more than once that, ‘You know, Hitler did some good things, too,’"" Kelly said. Kelly also confirmed previous reports about Trump speaking admiringly of Hitler’s military control. The Times linked to a 2022  New Yorker  article, drawn from the book "" The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021 ,"" that said: (Trump’s) loud complaint to John Kelly one day was typical: ""You f------ generals, why can’t you be like the German generals?"" ""Which generals?"" Kelly asked. ""The German generals in World War II,"" Trump responded. ""You do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?"" Kelly said. The New York Times also cited a  2021 article  in The Guardian about a  book by Michael Bender , then a Wall Street Journal reporter, who wrote that during a 2018 visit to Europe to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, Trump said to Kelly: ""Well, Hitler did a lot of good things."" When the Times asked Kelly whether Trump is a fascist, Kelly read aloud a definition of fascism and said Trump ""falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure."" An  Oct. 22 story in The Atlantic , also chronicled Trump making statements envious of Hitler’s military power, saying, ""I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,"" attributing the information to two people who were not named. There is one record of someone calling Trump Hitler: Trump’s running mate. Before becoming Trump’s ally and defender, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio,  criticized Trump ,  writing  in 2016 that he went ""back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical a-hole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he’s America’s Hitler."" Trump said Harris called him Adolf Hitler. Harris did not call Trump Hitler. She referred to statements from Trump’s former chief of staff who described to The New York Times instances of Trump speaking admiringly of Hitler and Hitler’s military control. When asked whether she believes Trump is a fascist, she said yes. We rate this statement False.

politifact,Ballot drop boxes 'were only used for a pandemic.',Drop boxes had been used for years without incident.     The popularity of drop boxes exploded during the 2020 pandemic.     The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled drop boxes were illegal in 2022; the court restored use of the boxes in 2024.,"In what will likely be the only U.S. Senate debate in Wisconsin, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Republican challenger Eric Hovde slugged it out over a variety of issues including health care, immigration, foreign policy, senior care and Social Security.  During the Oct. 18 debate, Hovde, a businessperson who ran unsuccessfully for Senate in Wisconsin in 2012, made a comment that piqued PolitiFact Wisconsin’s interest.  ""We have to create confidence in our voting system,"" he said. ""It is causing too much tension in our country, and let me tell you it doesn’t help when our state Supreme Court brings back drop boxes when those were only used for a pandemic.""  Were drop boxes ""only used for a pandemic?"" Let’s take a look. Drop boxes are receptacles in which voters can return their completed absentee ballots, rather than through the mail, at a clerk's office or at their polling place. In 2020 guidance to clerks,  the Wisconsin Elections Commission described them  as a secure, locked box, staffed or unstaffed, that should be permanently cemented to the ground and made of a durable material like steel. They can cost as much as $6,000. Drop boxes are more secure than mailboxes and typically weigh more than 600 pounds.  According to a July 2024 Wisconsin Elections Commission  draft guidance mem o, the use of drop boxes is not mandatory and is at the municipal clerk’s discretion.  Milwaukee will operate 14 ballot drop boxes for the November election, almost all of them by public libraries, the  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  reports. All drop boxes in Milwaukee are in well-lit areas on city government property with 24-hour security cameras nearby. The boxes are made of heavy-duty steel and permanently bolted into the ground — meaning they are designed to withstand weather elements and any tampering or stealing attempts. RELATED:  PolitiFact: Donald Trump says the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision declaring ballot drop boxes illegal ""includes the 2020 Presidential Election.""  Wisconsin Republicans and Democrats supported drop boxes before the 2020 election, but use of the boxes became a partisan issue after Donald Trump lost to President Joe Biden in Wisconsin by a little more than  20,600  votes in 2020.   The Wisconsin Supreme Court  ruled drop boxes illegal in 2022 . But Wisconsin’s newly liberal-controlled  Supreme Court in July 2024  restored the use of  absentee ballot drop boxes  in the swing state. So, what about Hovde’s assertion that drop boxes were ""only used for a pandemic""? Drop boxes have been used for years without incident, but their popularity exploded in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Then, in August 2020, as  PolitiFact  reported, Trump called drop boxes ""a voter security disaster"" and tried to cast doubt about their control. Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute and the former head of elections in Denver, told  PolitiFact  in October 2020 that ballot drop boxes have been in use for about two decades.  In Wisconsin, according to a  Wisconsin Supreme Court  brief dated April 18, municipal clerks across the state have regularly used ballot drop boxes, many since the 1980s or 1990s.  But their use did increase dramatically during the pandemic in 2020, when 500 boxes were available to voters in 430 communities across the state, according to an  Associated Press  report. Many of those boxes were removed after the initial Supreme Court decision outlawing them. It’s unclear exactly how many drop boxes will be available for use in this year’s vote, but it likely will be far fewer than in 2020. Many conservative communities have opted out of using the boxes in 2024, according to the AP report. Hovde said ballot drop boxes ""were only used for a pandemic."" Drop boxes have been in use for decades in Wisconsin, at least since the 1980s or ’90s, with use of the boxes becoming even more popular during the pandemic and heavily used during the presidential election of 2020.

politifact,The Biden-Harris administration “brought over” 10 million migrants who got 9 million jobs.,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection has recorded 10.5 million encounters so far during President Joe Biden’s presidency. More than 4.2 million of the 10.5 million encounters resulted in people being deported from the country.      U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows employment for foreign-born people in the U.S. is up by 6.1 million since Biden took office. But this figure refers to all people born outside of the U.S., not just migrants who came to the U.S. during Biden’s presidency.","Immigration as the cause of American job losses was a topic of discussion during former President Donald Trump’s Oct. 15 campaign rally in Atlanta.  ""The Biden-Harris administration also touts all this job growth, but they fail to mention the 10 million migrants they brought over here and the 9 million jobs they got,"" conservative commentator Michaelah Montgomery said during a speech at the rally, a clip of which was shared on  Threads .  This post, which did not name the video’s speaker, was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Montgomery did not respond to questions about her figures. Both numbers are inflated.  We  rated   False  previous claims that 10 million migrants entered the U.S. under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ administration. That’s because the figure stems from  data  on nationwide encounters with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But ""encounters"" refers to the number of stops by border officials, not the number of people entering the U.S.; the same person could be stopped multiple times. And many people are turned away. The most recent  data  shows nearly 10.5 million encounters from February 2021, the first month Joe Biden was president, to September 2024, and more than  4.2 million  of those encounters ended in people being deported from the country. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks employment for foreign-born and native-born people. That  data  shows employment among foreign-born people is up by 6.1 million since Biden took office in 2021, not 9 million. Further, the 6.1 million figure refers to anyone born outside of the U.S., including people who have been in the U.S. for decades as green card holders or naturalized citizens. Migrants who entered the U.S. during Biden’s presidency represent a fraction of those included in the 6.1 million figure. By contrast,  native-born employment  is up by 7.6 million since Biden became president. Finally, the claim’s phrasing distorts reality in other ways. The Biden-Harris administration did not ""bring"" any of these migrants to the U.S.; they came on their own. The claim that the Biden-Harris administration brought 10 million migrants to the U.S., and they got 9 million jobs is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s secretary of the commonwealth,  has said  it’s unlikely the state will declare a winner on election night.  In Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson  has said  she expects unofficial election results will be completed the day after Election Day. Clerks and election workers there are not allowed to start calculating the results of ballots from early voting sites until polls close on election night, according to the Michigan Department of State’s  website , though a new law lets local election officials start processing absentee mail ballots the week before election day.  In 2020, the law precluded election workers from counting mail ballots until the night before Election Day. Former President Donald Trump had an early lead in the vote count on election night, The Associated Press  reported , but only 45% of all votes were reported by midnight and ""that lead began to erode overnight and early Wednesday morning."" President Joe Biden took the lead later that afternoon, and  Trump falsely claimed  that was because of voter fraud. The new law could mean results will be more quickly reported this year after polls close. In Georgia, elections officials  can’t start processing mail ballots  until the morning of Election Day. In 2020, more than three-quarters of all votes cast were reported by midnight, the AP said. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger recently  rebuffed  former President Donald Trump’s claim that it could take seven days to count all of the state’s votes. Rather, he said in an Oct. 20 interview on CBS News’ ""Face the Nation,"" that all of the state’s early votes must be tabulated by 8 p.m. on Election Day, and overseas ballots  must be received  no later than the Friday after Election Day.  But delayed election results in Georgia weren’t evidence of election fraud in 2020, and they aren’t now.

The  Bucks County Republican Party  also said ""no employee at Bucks County Board of Election meets the description of the person in the video"" and that no mail-in or absentee ballots have been opened. The Bucks County district attorney’s office and the Yardley Borough police department  said Oct. 24  that its investigation concluded the video was ""fabricated in an attempt to undermine confidence in the upcoming election."" The district attorney’s office said it is in contact with the FBI, which aims to find the source of the ""manufactured video."" Manuel Gamiz Jr., Bucks County district attorney’s office spokesperson, told PolitiFact that multiple inconsistencies led the office to conclude that the ballots in the video are fake, but did not want to reveal specifics and ""inspire any copycats."" PolitiFact has not been able to trace the video’s origin or independently verify its authenticity. But experts believe it was not generated by artificial intelligence.  ""There is nothing in this video that has the characteristics or tell-tale signs of AI-generation,"" said Hany Farid, University of California, Berkeley, professor who specializes in digital forensics. ""I suspect that this is simply staged."" Siwei Lyu, University at Buffalo professor and director of its Media Forensic Lab, said he knows of no public-domain generative AI model that creates the kind of believable hand movements as seen in the video. ""This video may be another example where the video is real, but the story is not,"" he said.

Darren Linvill, Clemson University communication professor and co-director of the Watt Family Innovation Center Media Forensics Hub,  posted Oct. 24   on X   that the narrative is the work of Russian network Storm-1516. In an email to PolitiFact, Linvill pointed out that the actor seems to have a West African accent, and Storm-1516 ""routinely employs actors from the St. Petersburg (Russia) immigrant community.""

politifact,“Ballots are not supposed to have fold lines or creases in the candidates name area” or it could invalidate your vote.,"Mark Lindeman, the policy and strategy director for Verified Voting, said a crease through a candidate’s name would have no impact on tabulating machines’ ability to read a ballot.     If a crease goes through the spot where voters mark their choice, multiple backup procedures ensure the vote is counted.     New Hampshire conducted a recount on some 2020 ballots that were creased where the vote is recorded. But the state passed bipartisan legislation to change the scanner settings so the problem wouldn’t happen again.","Could submitting a ballot with folds through a candidate’s name invalidate your vote? That’s what a recent Facebook post said.  On Oct. 22, a Facebook user in Wisconsin  posted : ""Ballots are not supposed to have fold lines or creases in the candidates name area. My clerk also told me that even in person paper ballots are susceptible to this rule where the fold lines would appear.""  The user said they reported the issue and their county clerk brought them a new absentee ballot. Another Facebook user reshared the post,  saying , ""Check your ballots! Folds, creases, and marks could invalidate your ballot. Be diligent."" However, voting specialists say that a crease through a candidate’s name would not invalidate a cast ballot. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Mark Lindeman, the policy and strategy director for Verified Voting, a group that works with election officials and policymakers on voting and technology issues, said the post’s author shouldn’t worry. ""It's almost impossible to design a ballot where the folds wouldn't go through any ‘name areas,’ and it's also pointless: The scanners could not care less whether there is a fold through someone's name or party affiliation,"" Lindeman said.  The Facebook post’s image of what looks like a creased ballot ""documents no problem whatsoever,"" Lindeman said. A potential problem could arise if a ""vote target,"" such as an oval the voter fills in to choose their candidate, has a crease through it. This scenario is more than just having a crease through the candidate’s name. Lindeman said some New Hampshire ballots in a state House race were the subject of a  hand recount  in 2020 because of this issue, and the state subsequently passed bipartisan legislation to change the scanner settings so the problem wouldn’t happen again.  Lindeman said ballot designers generally take special effort to make sure this doesn’t happen. ""Mail ballots are designed so that the folds won't go through vote targets,"" Lindeman said. Plus, he said, ""modern scanners like those used in most of Wisconsin generally count ballots accurately no matter how they're folded. Good ballot design provides an extra measure of protection."" Lindeman said that, in most states, if a mail ballot can't be scanned for any reason, including problems related to a crease, election officials will either manually tally the ballot for inclusion in the totals, or create and scan a ""remake"" of the ballot which then is kept with the original. They do this rather than asking the voter to fix their ballot because at this point in the process, the ballot would be separated from any information about who cast it. The Wisconsin Elections Commission didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but its  Election Day Manual  describes scenarios that could warrant a ballot ""remake."" Lindeman said a crease over the spot where the voter marks their choice could fool the machine into thinking the voter selected two choices; if that were to happen, the manual says, two election inspectors must work with the voter to replace the ballot with one that meets the requirements and reflects the voter’s intent. Lindeman said the Facebook user may have misinterpreted the election worker’s decision to bring him a new ballot.

In 2020, 4,125 Amish adults registered out of nearly 17,000 eligible Amish people in Lancaster County,  according to a 2023 study  published by the Journal of Plain Anabaptist Communities. Of that figure, 2,940 people voted, the study said. Nolt said it was unlikely there would be a dramatic change in the 2024 election.  ""It would still undoubtedly be a minority of eligible Amish voters, given the church’s longstanding discouragement of voting,"" Nolt said. We asked the Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees the commonwealth’s elections, whether it had records on Amish voter registration. The agency said it does not collect such information. The state’s  voter registration form  does not ask about religious identity.

politifact,"""Nicki Minaj just endorsed Donald Trump for President.”",There’s no evidence that rapper Nicki Minaj has publicly endorsed Donald Trump over Kamala Harris for president.     Some posts making the claim shared a 5-year-old video in which she didn’t endorse Trump.,"Rapper Nicki Minaj once dedicated her hit song ""Anaconda"" to both Donald Trump and Joe Biden before either man was president ""in the spirit of unity"" in April 2016 at the Time 100 Gala in New York City. E! News  reported  Minaj worked both Trump’s and Biden’s names into the lyrics, and afterward, asked the crowd, ""Who do you think likes the biggest butts, Donald Trump or Joe Biden?"" But some social media users say the rap star is taking sides in this year’s presidential election and has endorsed Trump, the Republican nominee, over Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. An Oct. 28  Threads post  said, ""BREAKING – Nicki Minaj just endorsed Donald Trump for President. This is a HUGE blow to Kamala! Q the Democrats calling Minaj a racist in 3, 2, 1."" We found no public evidence that Minaj has publicly endorsed Trump in the Nov. 5 election.  We  found  other social media posts claiming that Minaj  endorsed  Trump,  some  of them  sharing  a 5-year-old  video  of Minaj in which she doesn’t endorse Trump. (Screenshots from X, Threads) That video is from Halloween 2019. Minaj is dressed as  ""Bride of Chucky,""  and her husband, Kenneth Petty, is dressed as Chucky, the killer doll from the ""Child’s Play"" horror movies and TV shows. In the video, the couple  joke  about her wedding ring and in character, Minaj said that because Chuck is an American, ""I can now fill out paperwork to vote in the United States of America of Donald Trump."" Trump was president in 2019 and she did not endorse him in the video. We searched Google News and the Nexis news database and found no credible articles about Minaj endorsing Trump. We also searched Minaj’s official  website  and  social   media  accounts and  found  no  posts  in which she endorsed Trump. PolitiFact contacted Minaj through her record label, but didn’t immediately get a response Minaj has spoken publicly about politics before. In December 2015, she  told Billboard magazine  that his presidential campaign was both ""childish"" and ""hilarious,"" and said it would make a good reality TV show. She didn’t take a side in that interview in the race between Trump and Hillary Clinton, and also spoke kindly of Clinton and then-President Barack Obama. In a  2018 Instagram post  that didn’t name Trump, Minaj was critical of U.S. immigration policy that separated children from their parents. She wrote, ""I came to this country as an illegal immigrant @ 5 years old. I can’t imagine the horror of being in a strange place & having my parents stripped away from me at the age of 5. This is so scary to me. Please stop this."" Minaj was born in Trinidad and Tobago and said in a  September TikTok live stream  that she is not a U.S. citizen. In a  February 2020 interview  at the Pollstar Live conference, Minaj said she wasn’t going to ""jump on the Donald Trump (hate) bandwagon,"" but again criticized his policies that separated immigrant families, saying ""it doesn’t sit right in my spirit."" She added, though, that ""on ‘Celebrity Apprentice,’ I think he was funny as hell."" In 2021, Minaj  questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines  and had a  public disagreement  with Biden’s White House about whether she was invited there to discuss them. The White House said she was offered a phone call with a doctor. But we found no evidence she has chosen a side in the current election between Trump and Harris. The claim is False.

Initially, the words were inaudible and interspersed with people booing the abortion access limitations Ivey described.      Once it was clear someone had summoned a medic, Ivey amplified the call for help and gestured to where help was needed. He kept gesturing until it was confirmed aid was provided.","Did doctors at Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign rally ignore a medical emergency that happened right in front of them? No, despite viral social media posts that claim otherwise.  The posts said a group of doctors who took the stage at Harris’ Oct. 25 Houston rally to advocate for abortion access declined to help when a medical emergency unfolded during the Democratic presidential nominee’s event.  Rogan O’Handley, a conservative who uses the handle DC_Draino, shared the claim in an  Oct. 26 Instagram post .

(Screenshot from Instagram) On the day of the rally, the Houston Chronicle reported that the city’s weather was  warmer than average , with temperatures in the mid-80s as thousands of people lined up outside Shell Energy Stadium, where Harris was set to appear with singers Beyoncé and Willie Nelson.  Although rally staff and police provided water and ice packs throughout the day, and cooling buses were present, KPRC-TV, a local news station,  reported  that emergency medical technicians responded to dozens of people who had heat-related symptoms and at least eight people were taken to nearby hospitals. Around 4 p.m. CDT, the Houston Fire Department  encouraged  rallygoers to ""practice heat safety."" If you're getting overheated and need a place to cool off,  @METROHouston  has a cooling bus at Capitol & St. Emanuel. There is another cooling bus from  @SETRAC_TX  at Rusk & St. Emanuel. Video of the rally shows that the social media posts mischaracterized how the events unfolded once the rally in the open-air stadium was underway. A group of people in white coats took the stage and a man who introduced himself as Dr. Todd Ivey, a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist in Houston stepped to the lectern.   ""We became doctors to take care of people, and when Donald Trump’s Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade, and unleashed the extreme abortion bans across our country, I could not believe what was happening,"" Ivey said, referring to  the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision  that ended federally protected abortion access. Ivey criticized Texas laws that prevent access to what he described as ""basic, essential medical care.""  About 2 minutes and 30 seconds into Ivey’s speech, voices from the crowd  called out . Initially, the words were inaudible and interspersed with people booing the abortion access limitations Ivey described.  About three minutes into Ivey’s speech, someone yelled what sounded like, ""Help! Medic!"" At that point, Ivey paused.  ""I think someone needs some medical assistance over here,"" he said into the microphone, pointing into the crowd. Someone who appeared to be wearing a white coat darted behind Ivey and the other doctors onstage.  That person moved out of the camera’s view, and the crowd began to cheer.  It’s unclear what happened off camera, but Ivey asked, ""Did they get someone — are they getting someone?"" Another person off camera responded: ""They’re OK.""  ""OK, great,"" Ivey said, and the crowd cheered. Before he could resume his speech, however, someone else in the crowd caught his attention. He paused again, pointing in a different direction and asking, ""Medical assistance?"" Someone replied, ""We’re good."" ""You’re good,"" he repeated, and returned to his remarks.  The incident lasted just more than a minute.  Video footage showed that Ivey stopped, called attention to the need for help and waited until he was certain the person in distress had been helped.  We contacted Harris’ campaign for comment on this episode and received no response. We also emailed and called Ivey but couldn’t reach him before publication.  The Houston Fire Department said it had no record of the rally incident and said Advantage Ambulance, a private contractor that provides emergency medical services, handled patient contacts inside the venue.

We caught them cold, 2,600 votes. ... And every vote was written by the same person.""  Trump then said sarcastically, ""I wonder how that happened? It must be a coincidence."" Earlier in the day, Trump made  similar comments on X , writing that Lancaster County was ""caught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person.""  Trump’s statements about ballots are wrong. Lancaster officials said that they were investigating suspect voter registration applications — which are not the same as ballots.  We asked the Trump campaign to provide evidence of 2,600 fraudulent ballots cast in Lancaster and got no response. Trump may have been drawing from Lancaster County election officials’ initial  Oct. 25 media statement  announcing a press conference that day. ""The Board of Elections and District Attorney will provide an update on how these ballots have been identified, isolated, and investigated,"" it stated. But Lancaster County spokesperson Michael Fitzpatrick said that the statement was corrected on the county’s website and social media feeds within minutes to say ""applications"" rather than ""ballots."" He said it was a typo. ""It is just applications,"" Fitzpatrick told PolitiFact. By the time Trump spoke days later, it was clear from official statements and media reports that the Lancaster investigation was about registration applications — not ballots. As a battleground state in what polls show is a very close presidential election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Pennsylvania is under intense scrutiny. It has 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state, and its election processes have been a source of  several   false   claims. Lancaster County prosecutors and election officials said in an Oct. 25  statement  after the press conference that they were reviewing 2,500 voter registration forms for ""suspected voter registration fraud"" that were dropped off at or near the voter registration deadline. Staff members noticed that numerous applications appeared to have the same handwriting and were filled out on the same day. Some of the applications were from previously registered voters and their signatures did not match the ones on file, county officials said.  Some applications contained correct personal identification information such as voters’ addresses, but the people listed on the applications informed detectives that they did not request or fill out the forms.  Lancaster County  District Attorney Heather Adams  said investigators found problems with 60% of registrations they had reviewed, but she did not say how many had been investigated. However, Adams said that some registration applications were legitimate and that a preliminary investigation signaled that these registration applications came from paid canvassers. She didn’t name them. Most of the officials’ statements at the press conference made it clear that their investigation was about applications to register — not votes cast.  However, Lancaster County Commissioner  Josh Parsons, chairman of the board, said , ""We isolated and contained all suspected fraudulent ballots,"" again echoing that word ""ballots.""  Commissioner Ray D’Agostino  said at the news conference that the applications were not for one party alone. People complete voter registration application forms when they register to vote; a ballot is a record of people’s votes. Election officials said that the suspect voter registration applications have been  set aside  as officials investigated them. We confirmed with Fitzpatrick, Lancaster County’s spokesperson, that if officials suspect that a voter registration application is fraudulent, that person who applied is not registered to vote and not sent a ballot. A similar investigation is underway in  York County, Pennsylvania . Kyle Miller, a state policy advocate in Pennsylvania for Protect Democracy, an advocacy group for fair elections, said the system worked as intended in Lancaster and York.  ""The county election officials properly reviewed and investigated any suspected fraudulent registrations proving that our system of checks is working to keep the PA election secure,"" Miller wrote in an email. But election law experts also said paid canvassers sometimes submit fraudulent voter registrations. The most famous case of that was with  ACORN , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now — multiple workers were convicted of voter registration fraud across several states and the group dissolved in 2010. Some states have set laws to regulate voter registration drives by outside groups.  ""There have been fraudulent registrations submitted in the past, often by paid circulators who are trying to produce forms so that they get paid,"" UCLA election law professor Richard Hasen said in an email. ""I’m not aware of a single case where a fraudulently submitted registration form led to a fraudulently cast ballot in elections. ‘Mickey Mouse’ may try to register, but he doesn’t show up to vote on election day."" The Center for an Informed Public  at the University of Washington found that both  liberal  and  conservative  social media accounts have used the investigations to spread rumors.  Investigators had yet to identify any suspect or describe any partisan motivation. Trump said that in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, ""We caught them with 2,600 votes. We caught them cold, 2,600 votes. ... And every vote was written by the same person."" Lancaster County election officials are investigating 2,500 voter registration forms for ""suspected voter registration fraud.""  In an early communication from the county’s elections office, a press release mistakenly described the problem as being with ""ballots."" But officials said soon after that the word ""ballots"" was a typo and subsequent statements said ""applications"" instead. Officials said that the registration applications they are reviewing had been set aside, which means the people they represent weren’t registered.  By the time Trump spoke days later, it was clear from official statements and media reports that the Lancaster investigation was about registration applications, not ballots.

politifact,Says opponent Eric Hovde “opposes efforts to negotiate with the big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs.”,"Repblican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde opposes the Inflation Reduction Act, which among other things, makes it possible to negotiate drug prices.     But he says drug prices are too high and negotiations with Big Pharma are needed","As the clock ticks toward Election Day 2024, candidate claims and counterclaims grow more pointed. In Wisconsin, the top statewide contest pits incumbent U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., against Republican challenger Eric Hovde.  During an Oct. 18 debate that included health care costs, Baldwin took aim at Hovde over pricey prescription medications.  ""He opposes efforts to negotiate with the big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs, saving patients and Medicare money,"" Baldwin said. But Hovde shot back.  ""I believe we need to negotiate with Big Pharma,"" said Hovde, who has multiple sclerosis. Hovde, as reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, was diagnosed with  multiple sclerosis  in May 1991.  ""I think our drug prices are too high. When I first started taking my medications for MS, they cost about $6,000 a year,"" Hovde said. ""Now they're costing $35,000 for generic drug prices. I'm against Big Pharma.""  So, is Hovde on board with lowering prescription drug prices or not? A Hovde spokesman did not respond to an email request for comment. But let’s take a look at Baldwin’s claim.  When asked to support Baldwin’s claim, a staff member pointed to several statements Hovde made opposing the Inflation Reduction Act, which, according to the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , made improvements to Medicare by expanding benefits and lowering drug costs. ""For the first time, the law provides Medicare the ability to directly negotiate the prices of certain high expenditure, single source drugs without generic or biosimilar competition,"" the  CMS.gov website  says.  The 2022  Inflation Reduction Act , among other provisions, included a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies and capped out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and insulin for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. The Biden administration said in August that, using the Inflation Reduction Act, it had negotiated with drugmakers to cut the cost of the 10 most expensive drugs under Medicare. But the bill also provided $369 billion in energy and climate change infrastructure.  During an August 2022 radio interview on the  ""Vicki McKenna Show,""  posted on  listennotes.com , Hovde referred to the Inflation Reduction Act as a ""big, ugly bill.""  When asked which federal programs he would cut if elected, Hovde, in an Oct. 1 radio interview with Joy Powers of  WUWM’s ""Lake Effect ,"" said he would cut federal spending to 2019 levels. Powers asked which programs Hovde would cut if he’s elected.  ""All federal programs spending went up, but the bulk of the increase were on things like the Inflation Reduction Act, the Chips Act, which, you know, I don't know why we spent so much money for corporate welfare for big chip makers.""  In an Oct. 8 op-ed Hovde penned and the  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  published, Hovde wrote: ""I will fight for increased price transparency throughout the health care system, empowering patients and employees to price shop and make informed decisions. I will fight to require health insurers … to disclose their negotiated drug rebates and discounts, revealing the true cost of prescription drugs."" So, basically, Hovde opposes the Inflation Reduction Act, a multifaceted bill that included a provision allowing negotiation of some Medicare drug prices for the first time.   Noting that, Hovde also has explicitly stated ""I believe we need to negotiate with Big Pharma"" and ""I think our drug prices are too high."" Hovde, before the Oct. 18 debate, has also discussed what he would do to curtail costs from pharmaceutical companies.  Baldwin said ""(Hovde) opposes efforts to negotiate with the big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs.""  Hovde has opposed the Inflation Reduction Act, which has been used to negotiate lower drug prices with drugmakers. But there’s also a lot of other spending, unrelated to drug prices, in the law, which Hovde calls inflationary. Nevertheless, Hovde has made it clear he believes drug prices are too high and ""we need to negotiate with Big Pharma"" and to put pressure on drugmakers in other ways.  For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate this Mostly False.     ",barely-true,Tammy Baldwin,2024-10-18,2024-10-31,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/prescription_drugs/7366fb9c57757fb6bb454a881a7ddcfb.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/31/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-falls-short-with-claim-on-hovdes-stance-on/,"Economy, Elections, Medicare, Wisconsin, 2024 Senate Elections, Tammy Baldwin"

politifact,"""Right to Try"" experimental drug program saved ""thousands and thousands of lives.""","Despite President Donald Trump’s claim, there’s no evidence the program had anywhere close to the effect he said it had — and experts say the measure weakened existing patient protections.  	  Although Trump has promised to expand the program if he wins the election, it’s unclear what more he could do.","Former President Donald Trump has boasted in recent months about ""Right to Try,"" a law he signed in 2018. It’s aimed at boosting terminally ill patients’ access to potentially life-saving medications not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. ""We have things to fight off diseases that will not be approved for another five or six years that people that are very sick, terminally ill, should be able to use. But there was no mechanism for doing it,"" Trump  said Aug. 30 , speaking in Washington, D.C., to supporters of the conservative parental rights advocacy group Moms for Liberty. He also said that because of Right to Try, ""we have saved thousands and thousands of lives.""  Trump similarly praised the program during an  Aug. 17 rally  in Pennsylvania, in a  podcast interview  with a conservative commentator and during his  Republican National Convention acceptance speech : ""Right to Try is a big deal,"" Trump said then.  Medical experts who’ve studied the experimental treatment program, however, say there’s no evidence to support Trump’s claims. These experts say Right to Try weakened regulations intended to protect patients.  The  Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act , aka Right to Try passed Congress on a bipartisan basis and was signed into law in 2018. It sought to streamline the process for getting potentially lifesaving drugs that weren’t yet Food and Drug Administration-approved to terminally ill patients. The speed matters; industry groups say it takes  10 to 15 years  on  average for a new medicine to reach pharmacy shelves.  However, a similar FDA program, the  expanded access  pipeline, sometimes called ""compassionate use,"" has existed  since the 1970s , and became law in 1987. And that is the root of many criticisms of Right to Try.   ""Right to Try is basically ‘expanded access light,’"" said Alison Bateman-House, a medical ethicist who researches access to investigational medical products at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.  Right to Try caters to fewer patients than expanded access and offers them fewer treatments, Bateman-House said. Patients must meet specific, but different, criteria to qualify for either experimental medication program. To qualify for expanded use, patients must have a ""serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition"" for which there is no ""comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition,"" according to  government regulations . Clinical trials must be infeasible for the patients and the use of these drugs must not interfere with any in-progress studies. Also the potential benefits must justify the risks, according to the prescribing physicians. Then, after identifying a treatment, the patient’s doctor must receive approval from its manufacturer, the FDA and the institutional review board overseeing the medication’s clinical trials.  The FDA said these steps exist so the agency can ""fairly weigh the risks and benefits"" of the medication and protect the patient’s safety. The agency also collects data about the drugs’ clinical impact on the patient and any adverse effects to inform the wider approval process for the drug. Right to Try sought to hasten this approval process. Under the new program, for instance, a doctor must merely identify an experimental medication and receive authorization to use it from the manufacturer. In most cases, the FDA has no authority to approve or deny the application, and there’s no review board process to navigate.  But, because of the Right to Try program’s definitions, fewer patients and fewer medicines qualify.  Under Right to Try, patients must have a ""life-threatening"" disease or condition, not just ""serious"" as with expanded access. Experimental medications are available only after they’ve completed Phase 1 clinical trials; treatments accessed through the expanded access program can be administered during a Phase 1 study. Right to Try, which includes liability protections for manufacturers and prescribing physicians, also weakens requirements that govern how doctors disclose experimental medications’ risks to patients, leaving  informed consent undefined. And it prevents the FDA from using information about how patients tolerate the drugs to ""delay or adversely affect the review or approval of such drug(s),"" unless top officials justify its benefit to public health in writing.  Supporters say Right to Try is an example of successful deregulation and claim that its more efficient approval process saved lives. But critics see this as a key reason for concern, because it ""opens up the opportunity of exploiting desperate patients,"" said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a bioethicist who studies pharmaceutical policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.  Government data shows regulatory agencies weren’t the main hurdle patients faced when seeking experimental drugs. The FDA almost always approved expanded access applications, and quickly by government standards. According to a  2018 FDA report  on the expanded access program, the FDA authorized 99% of the roughly 9,000 requests it received in the previous five years, approving emergency requests for experimental medications in less than one day on average. More  recent data  shows that approval trend has continued, even as the number of applications has grown each year. In rare cases in which the FDA didn’t automatically approve requests, regulators often didn’t deny them, but recommended tweaks to the requested dosage to address safety and effectiveness concerns.  The FDA does not share detailed information about the number of doses provided or patients treated under Right to Try. Instead, it posts only an  annual summary  showing how many drugs have been approved under the program. The agency says that since Right to Try began in 2018 it has approved 16 treatments: 12 from 2018 to 2022 and four last year. The FDA declined to provide additional information about the number of Right to Try requests or approvals. Although the 16 medications approved through Right to Try were possibly provided to more than one patient each, experts said it’s extremely unlikely  thousands of patients were impacted, as Trump said.  Trump’s claim represents an ""egregious overestimate of the number of people who are using Right to Try,"" said Fernandez Lynch, noting she believes the real numbers are ""very, very low."" The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple inquiries about the source of the former president’s statistics. Karoline Leavitt, the campaign’s national press secretary, told KFF Health News that in a second term ""President Trump will of course remain open to other pathways to expand ‘Right to Try’ to save more American lives."" It remains unclear how Trump might expand the program, though the Goldwater Institute is advocating for "" Right to Try 2.0 ,"" which it claims will let patients receive individualized therapeutics.  Experts noted such drugs are already accessible through the expanded access program.  Meanwhile, evidence shows that the high price of experimental treatments, which are sometimes available through certain drug company programs but not typically covered by insurance, is a greater hurdle to patients than regulatory guardrails are.   ""I don't think that people are having a problem with the FDA blocking access to individualized therapeutics,"" Bateman-House said. ""I think the problem is that individualized therapeutics are incredibly expensive, and there's only a very small number of researchers in the country who know how to make them.""  Trump has claimed throughout the campaign that his Right to Try program is novel and has saved thousands of lives. But a similar program has existed for decades, and there is no evidence Right to Try has had anywhere close to the impact Trump said it’s had.  Neither the Trump campaign nor Right to Try advocates provided evidence to back claims of widespread benefit. And government data shows only 16 medications have been approved under the program in its first six years, with no accounting of how many patients used those medications or their clinical outcomes.   Moreover, public health experts have said Right to Try weakens patient protections and fails to address the true barriers to experimental medications.  We rate Trump’s claim False.  ",false,Donald Trump,2024-08-30,2024-10-31,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/trump_right_to_try_11_1_2024/140cb717fca694641a894163927671fa.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/31/donald-trump/no-evidence-trumps-experimental-drug-program-for-t/,"Elections, Health Care, Health Check, Donald Trump"

""Yet more evidence in support of my assertion that Early Voting is designed to enable election fraud."" The Facebook post shared a screenshot of  an X post  by Matthew DePerno, a former candidate for Michigan attorney general and the state’s Supreme Court. DePerno is  awaiting trial  on felony charges related to an alleged  conspiracy  to tamper with voting machines after the 2020 general election. DePerno said the numbers were discovered in a review of the state’s Qualified Voter File and showed votes cast as of Oct. 29. He shared an image of what he said were 29 votes recorded from a single voter ID in Wayne County, and tagged Elon Musk and the Republican Party on X. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) But the post is misleading. Data shown on the social media posts doesn’t mean that one voter cast multiple votes, the Michigan Department of State  explained on its website , attributing it to a formatting error in the Qualified Voter File. (Screenshot from Facebook) The  claims  about  excess  votes from single voters in Michigan  spread   widely  on social media. DePerno’s X post had  more than 5.6 million views  and 28,000 reshares on X as of Oct. 31. Rasmussen Reports, a conservative polling company,  shared the same image  on X and garnered 7.6 million views and 16,000 reshares. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office addressed the claims in an  Oct. 30 Facebook post  that said, ""A recent social media post has taken a data report that included formatting errors to incorrectly claim that individual voters were casting multiple ballots in this election."" In  an Oct. 31 X post , Benson wrote, ""Expect bad actors to take minor issues and use them to fuel baseless conspiracy theories in order to further their own agenda.""  Both secretary of state posts  linked  to the state’s Election Fact Center, which has a long post addressing the issue. A fact center’s  headline said, ""The Qualified Voter File only allows one ballot to be accepted per voter in every election – a formatting error has been corrected."" The lengthy post added that ""a recent social media has taken a data report that included formatting errors to incorrectly claim that individual voters were casting multiple ballots in this election. The data error has been identified and corrected."" The post said the file has a record of each qualified and registered voter and each record has  a voter ID with a unique identifier. When a voter moves, the address change history is added to the file. The registration, however, is only active at the last address at which a voter registered, the post said.  ""The QVF does NOT allow for multiple ballots to be accepted for the same voter or Voter ID,"" the post said in bold letters. The post said Michigan’s Bureau of Elections identified the formatting error in a routine report that shows a list of voters who have cast ballots early for by absentee ballot. The error generated a line for each voters’ former addresses, resulting in the list showing multiple addresses associated with one voter ID.  ""Each of these voters only had one vote recorded for this election,"" the post said, adding that the error has been fixed. Despite the explanation that no excess votes were counted, some conservatives took credit on social media for preventing it. The claim caught the attention of Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law. She  said on X,  ""We immediately investigated and have CONFIRMED that it was a glitch in the system – these duplicates were not and WILL NOT BE COUNTED. We are on it and protecting the vote!"" Rogan O’Handley, a conservative who uses the social media handle DC_Draino, credited the RNC,  writing on Instagram , ""This is how we win. We just stopped 168,000 fake ballots from being counted in Michigan in only hours after it was discovered."" Michigan secretary of state spokesperson Angela Benander told PolitiFact in an email that ""the error had been previously caught and corrected"" before the social media posts. A social media post claimed that in Michigan, 279,113 ballots were cast by only 114,545 voters, meaning that 164,568 illegal votes were cast. Some voters were casting multiple ballots using the same voter ID and different addresses, the post claimed. Michigan’s State Department said a formatting error, which has been fixed, in its Qualified Voter File showed lines for multiple addresses for some voter IDs that had cast ballots. The voter file keeps previous addresses on record, even if the voter moves, but a voter’s registration is active only for the last registered address. The system does not allow for multiple votes from the same ID, the state said. A formatting error in a report showed multiple addresses for some voters who had cast ballots, but only one vote per ID had been counted.

The woman did not intend nor try to vote a second time, Channell said. Channell said the system is typically updated across all polling places within minutes of a person voting but on that day, it experienced a lag. However, that doesn’t mean a person voting more than once would not be detected.  ""If a person would try to exploit that delayed system and vote a second time, eventually, once the system did sync, it would show that the person voted a second time,"" Channell  said.

Grushkowsky said she saw the sign when driving on the road and stopped to take photos, which she shared online.

Officials said the Laurel County voter who initially had the problem was able to cast her ballot, which was correctly marked with her chosen candidates.","On Halloween, days before Election Day, some social media users claimed something scary was happening with Kentucky voting machines. An Oct. 31  X post  shared a video of a person trying repeatedly to select the Republican ticket, former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, for president and vice president in the 2024 election. The Kentucky voter using the voting machine tried to make this selection by finger-tapping the small check box in the top left corner of a text field featuring Trump and Vance’s names. After multiple tries, one of the person’s taps instead selected the Democratic ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. ""Some voting machines in Kentucky are NOT ALLOWING voters to select President Trump,"" the X post said. ""Instead, when they tap ‘Trump,’ Kamala Harris ends up being selected."" Podcaster Joe Rogan  amplified  this video on X, where it has received millions of views, asking people if it was ""Broken machine or election fraud?"" (Screenshots from X and Instagram) Users on  TikTok   and   Instagram   also  shared the video, making similar claims in English and Spanish. TikTok identified the video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. And the Instagram posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnerships with  TikTok  and  Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) But Kentucky election officials emphasized that this incident was isolated and it does not show fraud or widespread election interference. Laurel County Clerk Tony Brown, a Republican,  posted  on Facebook at 1:43 p.m. on Oct. 31 that he was alerted to an incident that day in which one of the ballot marking machines malfunctioned. He wrote that the machine had been taken out of service and the county contacted the state attorney general’s office. ""We checked it and couldn’t make it recreate the incident reported,"" Brown  wrote . ""We had no complaints prior to or after the complaint. We have left the machine in full view and are awaiting further directions."" At 5:13 p.m., Brown gave an  update  on the situation, after the attorney general’s office had visited the vote center to inspect the device. ""In full disclosure, after several minutes of attempting to recreate the scenario, it did occur,"" Brown  wrote  in a Facebook post. ""This was accomplished by hitting some area in between the boxes. After that we tried for several minutes to do it again and could not."" Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican,  posted  on X that his office’s Department of Criminal Investigations responded quickly to the Laurel County complaint. The department’s detectives recommended that the county clerk change out the voting machine. ""All Kentucky voters can have confidence that our elections are secure and any potential issues will be addressed quickly,"" Coleman  wrote  on X. Brown  explained  on Facebook that the voting machine in the viral video is a ballot marking device, which marks blank ballots by how voters select options on the screen. Voters can review their selections before submitting their ballots. If voters are satisfied with their choices, they can print the completed ballot and place it in the scanner. If voters make a mistake or there’s an error with the ballot, voters can ""spoil"" that ballot and receive another one. Kentucky law allows voters to spoil up to two ballots per election, Brown  wrote . Brown also  shared  a video of a county official testing the same voting machine used in the viral video. The official tried tapping the small check box, as the person in the viral video had, but it didn’t work. When the official tapped the center of the candidate’s name field, the box turned green to show it was selected. ""These ballot marking devices are set for a voter to touch inside the whole box with the name of the candidates. In the video posted you can see us going back and forth through the names with no issues,"" Brown  wrote . ""There were no claims of any issues with the device prior, and none since it went back into service."" Brown and Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, confirmed that the voter who had the problem was able to cast her ballot, which was correctly marked and printed with her chosen candidates. ""There is no ‘vote-switching,’"" Adams  wrote  on X, adding that people should get their voting information from ""legitimate sources."" James Young, a former Kentucky election administrator and registered Republican, echoed this,  posting  on X that the viral video showed no fraudulent activity or ""vote flipping."" He wrote that the errant ballot selection appeared to happen because of where the voter had tapped the screen. ""If you look closely, the voter is attempting to press the small check box located within the text box. Consistently, the voter gently presses their finger on the thin border, which at times can cause an adjacent text box to highlight instead of their intended choice,"" Young  wrote . ""Had the voter pressed the center of the text box, this would not have occurred.""

The man in the video is not a ballot mule — someone who illegally collects and offloads ballots.

You’re supposed to only turn in one ballot per person."" The man doesn’t answer and places the container — which says ""United States Postal Service"" on the side and appears to contain mail ballots — on an X-ray machine’s conveyor belt. The person filming asks, ""Do you have an affidavit for all those?"" A man off camera says the man with the ballots is with the post office.  Another person off camera asks, ""Who is he?"" and the person filming replies, ""I don’t know, apparently he’s with the post office, but that looks very suspect. There’s somebody here in Northampton County dropping off an obscene amount of ballots at the very last second after the office has actually closed."" The claim originated on an X account that  posted the video  Oct. 29, asking for help identifying the man with the ballots. That post had garnered 5.8 million views as of Nov. 1. ""Need help identifying this guy that just dropped off an insane amount of ballots who says he’s with the post office but (I don’t know) if I buy that. He wouldn’t talk to us and was acting very suspect,"" said the X user, whose  profile  says he’s a regional coordinator for  Early Vote Action , a grassroots movement to register Republicans and encourage them to vote early.  Conservative X accounts, including conspiracy theorist  Alex Jones  and  MJTruthUltra , shared the video. (Screenshots from X) Later posts named the person carrying the ballots and some people posted photos of a vehicle’s license plate, claiming the postal worker is from Rhode Island. The camera zooms in on the man who dropped off the ballots, then a uniformed person enters the frame and takes the ballots. Johnson, the Postal Service spokesperson, declined to name the worker in the video, but confirmed he is a postal employee. The man has been named in some news accounts, but PolitiFact is declining to name him to protect his safety and privacy.  ""We have a process for delivering Election Mail, including ballots, and our employee is following it,"" Johnson wrote in an email. ""While this employee doesn’t wear a uniform or drive a postal vehicle in the normal course of his duties, he is a postal employee, and appropriately delivering those ballots."" Johnson pointed to an Oct. 23 Postal Service  press release  that details the agency’s ""extraordinary"" nationwide measures to ensure secure, quick mail ballot processing. Those measures include extra deliveries and local handling and transportation of mail ballots. Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt referred to the video Oct. 31 near the end of his  daily media briefing  about the Nov. 5 election when he described mis- and disinformation being shared online. ""Another video shared widely yesterday that I saw showed an acting postmaster himself bringing mail ballots to the Northampton County election office, literally just delivering the mail,"" Schmidt said.

Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure replied  from his X account  to the original X post that asked for help identifying the man, saying, ""We can help you. It's literally the postmaster."" McClure didn’t immediately return our request for comment, but  told The Morning Cal l, an Allentown, Pennsylvania, newspaper, ""What was occurring here was the most normal, legal thing imaginable.""

Sound familiar?  It’s the latest video that officials suspect originated from Russian actors trying to sow chaos ahead of the election and it follows a pattern we’ve seen in  other recent videos . The video surfaced Oct. 31 in  multiple   X   posts  showing a man who appears to be in a vehicle with other people. He claims they are Haitians who ""came to America six months ago"" and have already gained American citizenship.  ""We’re voting Kamala Harris,"" he said. ""Yesterday we voted in Gwinnett County and today we are voting in Fulton County."" Both counties are in Georgia, a swing state. The camera flips to show the man holding four driver’s licenses, with what appears to be the same photo in all of them. Another hand appears in the frame, holding four more driver’s licenses. The second set of driver’s licenses uses a different photo.  ""We have all our documents, driver’s license,"" the man said. ""We invite all Haitians to come to America and bring families."" A ""Harris Walz"" cap is visible in the background. ""Breaking: illegal Haitian migrants voting multiple times in the Georgia election,"" read an  Oct. 31 X post . ""Election fraud in plain sight."" The claim was also  shared  on X’s  Election Integrity Community , which was launched by Elon Musk’s political action committee for members to ""share potential incidents of voter fraud.""  (Screenshot from X) Election-related falsehoods, such as the  claim  that voters in Tarrant County, Texas, were  reporting instances of machines flipping votes , have spread in this group, which now has more  than 58,000 members.   There were already signs the video was dubious: Why would anyone admit to voter fraud on camera while brandishing their personal information? When you look closely at the details, more falsehoods appear. Authorities have debunked the claim and linked it to Russian actors. In a  Nov. 1 joint statement , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said, ""Russian influence actors manufactured a recent video that falsely depicted individuals claiming to be from Haiti and voting illegally in multiple counties in Georgia."" ""This judgment is based on information available to the IC (intelligence community) and prior activities of other Russian influence actors, including videos and other disinformation activities,"" the statement read. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger  issued a statement Oct. 31  calling the video ""false"" and ""an example of targeted disinformation."" ""It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election,"" his statement read. Raffensperger said the federal cybersecurity agency is investigating the matter, and urged X owner Elon Musk and the heads of other social media platforms to take down the video.  ""This is obviously fake and part of a disinformation effort. Likely it is a production of Russian troll farms,"" Raffensperger said. Georgia Secretary of State Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling also  disputed the claim on X , saying, ""This is not true. It is classic disinformation. The likeliest suspect is a Russian troll farm."" The names in the two IDs were readable: Raoul Sylvan and Jacques Benoit. Their dates of birth are also visible. When PolitiFact did searches using these names and birthdays in Gwinnett and Fulton counties, no results appeared on  Georgia’s voter page . PolitiFact also tested for other potential variations, such as "" Jacques Bencit ."" The addresses in the driver’s licenses are in Lawrenceville and Duluth, which are both in Gwinnett County. Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who specializes in digital forensics, told PolitiFact the video had no signs of artificial intelligence generation or manipulation, and that it seems ""simply staged.""  ""If you view the video at full resolution, you can see the eyes (of) the person talking scanning back and forth as if he is reading from a script,"" Farid said. ""This is a cheap — and pretty lazy — fake."" Siwei Lyu, University at Buffalo professor and director of its Media Forensic Lab, agreed with Farid, saying the video exhibits no significant deepfake markers. ""This is likely to be a real video, but the story may not be,"" Lyu said. Darren Linvill, a Clemson University communication professor who has been tracking Russian disinformation,  said on X  that the video has ""several hallmarks of the Russian, Storm-1516 campaign."" Linvill also co-directs Clemson University’s Watt Family Innovation Center Media Forensics Hub. The same campaign was believed to have been behind the viral video of an election worker allegedly ripping up ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. We rated that claim  Pants on Fire ! In an email to PolitiFact, Linvill said his team spots narratives from Storm-1516 based on their narrative focus, style and production and distribution network. ""This one, for instance, is attacking election integrity, a focus of Russian disinformation for many years,"" Linvill said. He said that based on Storm-1516’s record of hiring actors from West Africa, it’s likely the people in this video also are West African immigrants who were recruited from St. Petersburg, Russia. Linville previously said the person in the video about Bucks County ballots being destroyed also seemed to have a West African accent and was likely from the same area. Linvill said his team tracks a network of pro-Russian websites and social media accounts that Storm-1516 is ""known to use."" He said in this case, the campaign used an X account called ""Alphafox"" that Linvill described as ""a guy in Massachusets they have used before."" NewsGuard  also found the post of ""Alphafox"" — now unavailable but  archived here  — to be the narrative’s earliest version. Haitians have been a  target of misinformation  worsened by claims that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating residents’ pets. Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance amplified these claims. The video doesn’t show Haitians voting for Harris multiple times in different Georgia counties. We rate that claim Pants on Fire!

politifact,Video shows a ‘Democratic operative’ making credible allegations of fraud during the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.,"Secretly recorded video showed a man identified as Joel Caldwell making unspecific, unsubstantiated allegations of election malfeasance and reviving long-debunked claims about Georgia’s 2020 presidential election.     The 2020 presidential election ballots in Georgia were counted three times and Joe Biden won each time. Republican state officials deny allegations of widespread fraud.     We found no news reports or other information supporting social media posts’ assertions that Caldwell was involved with Georgia’s Democratic Party, and a party spokesperson said no one named Joel Caldwell was on the party’s payroll during the 2020 election cycle.","Across the U.S., voters are focused on the 2024 presidential election, visiting polls and casting ballots. On social media, however, some social media users’ sights are set firmly on reexamining the last presidential election’s results. Conservative commentator Steven Crowder shared a video to his Instagram account that purported to feature a man named Joel Caldwell.  ""CAUGHT ON TAPE: Democratic Operative Details Potentially Illegal Ballot Harvesting Schemes Used to Rig American Elections; Appears to Admit 2020 Election Fraud Took Place in Georgia,"" Crowder captioned  the Oct. 28 post , which accompanied what looks like a surreptitiously recorded video of a man talking about the 2020 election in Georgia.  Crowder tied the video to the current election with a warning for his followers: ""please be aware of this type of activity ahead of Election Day!""  He shared this video on Instagram,  Facebook  and  X . Conservative websites including  The Gateway Pundit  also covered it.  This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) (Screenshot from Instagram) The video does not include credible allegations of fraud during the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. In it, Caldwell mentions a specific incident involving a plumbing leak, but officials who investigated the situation found no evidence of fraud. State investigations more broadly have uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud in Georgia’s 2020 presidential election. Caldwell is not linked to the Democratic Party. In tiny text, the video provided a disclaimer: ""This opinion piece is presented for informational and discussion purposes only. The truth or falsity of these statements has not been verified.""  A person identified only as an ""undercover journalist"" filmed Caldwell, and the video showed no sign that Caldwell knew he was being recorded. We contacted Crowder to ask whether it was someone working for his show, ""Louder With Crowder,"" and received no response. The video itself included no such disclosure. Dates that appear on the screen said Caldwell was filmed on Feb. 6, 2024, in the first portion of the video, and Nov. 18, 2023, in the second portion.  In just over nine minutes, Caldwell made multiple claims about Georgia’s 2020 election, including that:  A plumbing leak at a Georgia vote counting center was used as cover for fraud that undercounted votes for former President Donald Trump. Video of a man putting 100 ballots into a ballot box proved fraud.  ""Groups"" paid people to collect absentee ballots and drop them in ballot boxes and, as Caldwell put it, ""forge ’em."" These claims are inaccurate. President Joe Biden  won the election . States certified the results, Congress accepted the results and Biden was inaugurated in January 2021. Although Trump continues to repeat the false claim that the election was stolen, Republican officials in Trump’s administration  and in Georgia  said the 2020 election was safe and secure.  In January, Georgia’s secretary of state’s office spokesperson Mike Hassinger  told PolitiFact  that at least 16 individual lawsuits were filed in Georgia to challenge the validity of Georgia’s 2020 election results.  ""Twelve were dismissed by the courts, and four withdrawn by former President Trump’s own lawyers,"" he said.  Nationwide, Trump and his allies lost more than  60 legal cases  challenging the election outcome. A group of conservatives, including former federal judges, examined Trump and his allies’ fraud and miscount claims and  concluded  that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results."" PolitiFact and other news organizations have rebutted Caldwell’s Georgia-specific claims: No proof of a leak-related cover-up:  At around 6 a.m. on Election Day, Nov. 3, 2020, there was  a water leak  at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, affecting the room where election workers from Fulton County, Georgia, were counting absentee ballots. Arena staff repaired the leak in about two hours,  the arena  said. Neither ballots nor tabulation equipment were damaged and the leak caused only ""a brief delay in tabulating absentee ballots,"" arena officials  said  in a statement.  On Dec. 5, 2021, Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state’s chief investigator, wrote in an  affidavit  that the secretary of state’s office had begun investigating after it received complaints that Fulton County Board of Registrations and Elections staff had ""directed clerks, public observers and media personnel to leave"" because of the leak — even though county staff continued to scan ballots.  Watson  wrote  that the morning leak ""did not affect the counting of votes"" later that day. Investigators interviewed witnesses and reviewed security footage from the arena taken from  Nov. 3, 2020, to Nov. 4, 2020, and ""discovered that observers and media were not asked to leave,"" he wrote, noting that ""they simply left on their own.""   No evidence of widespread fraud or many illegally submitted absentee ballots:  Caldwell’s second and third allegations sound like descriptions of ""ballot harvesting,"" a term that  generally refers  to someone collecting absentee ballots and submitting them on others’ behalf.  We were unable to find a video of a man depositing 100 ballots, as Caldwell mentioned. But investigations into allegations that three surveillance clips showed people dropping off multiple absentee ballots illegally proved the claims false. When state investigators interviewed the people shown depositing ballots, they learned those people were dropping off ballots for members of their households, which is legal in Georgia, The Washington Post  reported .  Nevertheless, conservative groups continuously pushed  baseless claims  — often from anonymous sources — about election fraud, often focused on ballot drop boxes. State officials said these claims  lacked  evidence.  Election fraud incidents in Georgia were so isolated that they could not have changed the election’s outcome. The Associated Press  reported  that officials in 24 of Georgia’s 159 counties identified 64 potential voter fraud cases. Of those, about half were determined to be an administrative error or other kind of mistake. Georgia’s  election results  show Biden won the state by 11,779 votes. ""Nobody forged any ballots in the 2020 election,"" Hassinger said. ""Georgia ballots are printed on security paper with detectable polymers embedded in them. This year, they’ll also be watermarked.""  The video identified Caldwell as ""director of operations"" for ""Coalition for the People’s Agenda (GA)."" The job aligns with a since-removed LinkedIn profile result for Joel Caldwell.  We tried calling Caldwell, left a message, and received no response.  We contacted The Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda to ask about Caldwell and received no response before publication. The group does not list its employees on its website.  The coalition  describes itself  as an ""umbrella organization"" of groups that ""advocate for voting rights protection, elimination of barriers to the ballot box, criminal justice reform, quality education, affordable housing, economic development and equal participation in the political process for Georgians of color and underrepresented communities."" The posts identified Caldwell as a ""Democratic operative,"" so we searched using Google and Nexis, a news database, and found no news reports or other information supporting the post’s assertion that Caldwell was involved with Georgia’s Democratic Party. PolitiFact couldn’t find voter registration information for Caldwell.   Dave Hoffman, the Democratic Party of Georgia’s communications director, said no one named Joel Caldwell was on the party’s payroll during the 2020 election cycle — or is involved with the party now. He stressed that Democratic Party of Georgia is not the same as the The Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda, which he was unfamiliar with.  Google search results for Caldwell also signaled that he once worked with Georgia STAND-UP, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization  advocating for  voting and other civic engagement, access to public transportation, affordable housing and Medicaid expansion in Georgia. We contacted Georgia STAND-UP and received no response.  Hassinger, of Georgia’s secretary of state’s office, said he’d never heard of Joel Caldwell, although the The Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda has  sued the agency , along with other organizations, over  alleged violations  of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, violation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the U.S. Constitution’s First and Fourteenth amendments. ""He’s never been employed by nor associated with the Secretary of State,"" Hassinger said. ""The claims of election insecurity and ballot harvesting in the 2020 election in Georgia have been debunked for years, and anyone repeating them is either lying or has been duped."" Instagram posts claim that Video shows a ""Democratic operative"" making credible allegations of fraud during the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. The man in the video is not involved with the Democratic Party of Georgia, a party spokesperson said. In the video, the man made unspecific, unsubstantiated allegations of election malfeasance or revived long-debunked claims. The 2020 presidential election ballots in Georgia were counted three times and Biden won each time. Republican state officials deny allegations of widespread fraud. We rate the claim False.

Owens has pushed  antisemitic conspiracy theories  and  falsehoods about the COVID-19 pandemic , and was recently  banned from entering Australia  for a planned speaking tour.  Owens did not directly make the claim about Harris’ mother. Instead, it was the topic of an interview she conducted for  her podcast  with a man who appears to have originated the claim.  Yoichi Shimatsu, who is described by Owens as a former editor of The Japan Times, claimed in a Rense.com  article  that Gopalan was a key player in the MK-Ultra program while living in Montreal, working to help train brainwashed assassins on behalf of the British government. The article cites no sources.

politifact,“The lady who leaked passwords for voting systems in Colorado is the same person who tried to remove Trump from the ballot.”,"Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said an employee who no longer works for the department accidentally publicly posted partial passwords to Colorado’s voting machines. A team is working to update the compromised passwords, she said.     Griswold wasn’t a plaintiff in the 2023 lawsuit to remove former President Donald Trump from Colorado’s primary presidential ballot — she was a defendant. During the Colorado Supreme Court case, she did not take a position on the ballot question but said the court would decide whether Trump would be disqualified from the election.      When the U.S. Supreme Court challenged Colorado’s decision to remove Trump from the state’s ballot, Griswold said Trump should stay off the ballot. ​","The Colorado secretary of state’s office accidentally published some voting machine passwords online ahead of Election Day, which led some social media users to disparage that office’s elected leader, Jena Griswold.  ""The lady who leaked passwords for voting systems in Colorado is the same person who tried to remove Trump from the ballot,"" the X account Libs of TikTok posted Oct. 30 with Griswold’s photo.  An Instagram user shared a  screenshot  of the post, and it was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) The social media posts exaggerate the details of what happened and make it sound as if  Griswold personally or maliciously leaked information that endangered the election process. That’s not what happened. And Griswold didn’t file the lawsuit that sought to remove former President Donald Trump from Colorado’s primary ballot in 2023; she was a defendant in the case. Griswold  told  Colorado Public Radio on Oct. 30 that an employee who no longer works for the department accidentally posted a spreadsheet on the Colorado secretary of state’s website that contained a tab with passwords to Colorado’s voting machines. She added that secretaries of state do not have access to voting machine passwords.  The passwords were taken down Oct. 24 after being publicly available for several months, Griswold  told  KUSA-TV, a Denver-based NBC affiliate. Each voting machine requires two passwords, and the spreadsheet contained one of the two, Griswald said.  A team is updating the compromised passwords, Axios  reported . Besides the two passwords, the voting machines require security clearance to access.  Libs of TikTok, which PolitiFact  has   previously   fact-checked , said Griswold is ""the same person who tried to remove Trump from the ballot."" That’s also not right.  In September 2023, six Colorado voters  sued  Griswold and demanded that she remove Trump from Colorado’s presidential primary ballot for his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election results. The voters cited the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist clause as grounds for their lawsuit.  Griswold ""was a defendant in this lawsuit, and did nothing to initiate it,"" Jack Todd, a secretary of state’s office spokesperson, told PolitiFact.  The Colorado Supreme Court, siding with the plaintiffs,  decided  Trump should be removed from the state’s primary ballot for his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, but the U.S. Supreme Court later  overruled  that decision.  Griswold did not take a position on the lawsuit before the state court’s ruling,  saying  the decision on whether Trump would be disqualified ""has to be decided by a court, not the public opinion of the nation.""  When the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, Griswold  said  Trump should be kept off Colorado’s ballot.  ""Colorado should be able to bar oath-breaking insurrections from our ballot,"" Griswold posted on  X , saying she was ""disappointed"" by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision. The Libs of TikTok X post said, ""The lady who leaked passwords for voting systems in Colorado is the same person who tried to remove Trump from the ballot."" Griswold did not personally leak Colorado’s voting machine passwords. Some were compromised after an employee, who no longer works for the department, accidentally posted a spreadsheet with a tab containing the passwords online.  Separately, Griswold was a defendant in the lawsuit to remove Trump from Colorado’s presidential primary ballot last year, and did not initiate the effort. She supported it when it was challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court.  The statement contains an element of truth — someone in Griswold’s office accidentally posted partial voting machines passwords online — but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

politifact,Video shows the FBI reported that “three linked groups have been apprehended for rigging early voting by mail-in ballot.”,,"A video shared on social media says the FBI has busted mail-in ballot rigging, but the video is fake, the agency said.  ""FBI Report: Three affiliated groups were arrested for rigging early voting with mail-in ballots,"" said a Nov. 1 X post sharing the video. The X account was suspended Nov. 3.  The 39-second video, which includes a seal in the upper right corner that says ""Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" begins with a photo of the back of a purported FBI agent standing over a vehicle.  The video’s narrator says, ""Three linked groups have been apprehended for rigging early voting by mail in ballot. List of names of recently deceased U.S. citizens and/or Americans aged 90 and over were used for electoral falsification.""  The narrator says investigative journalist Eliot Higgins commented on the operation to the FBI. Higgins is founder of Bellingcat, an investigative journalism group.  Then the narrator attributes this statement to Higgins: ""We have seen this before in 2020. The FBI did a great job but that does not mean the election results will be transparent and honest. We don’t know how many such groups, acting on behalf of the Democrats, there are still in the United States.""  Higgins told us via email that he didn’t say that. Higgins also posted Nov. 2 on X , ""This is part of the Russian disinformation campaign that's published dozens, if not hundreds of videos making various false claims, along with fake ‘verified’ QR codes. All the views, (retweets), and likes you see on this post are inauthentic, all from for-hire bot networks the people running the campaign regularly use."" Higgins wrote that while Russia has tried to influence the U.S. election, ""It's had zero impact on the election, and has just been a good way for some oligarch to make a bunch of money off his Russian government master."" The FBI said in a  Nov. 2 statement,  ""The FBI is aware of two videos falsely claiming to be from the FBI relating to election security, one stating the FBI has apprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud and a second relating to the Second Gentleman. These videos are not authentic, are not from the FBI and the content they depict is false."" One sign that the video is fake: it lacks basic details such as where the alleged crime took place and how many rigged ballots were cast. It also plays on a common theme of election falsehoods that ballots were cast in the names of dead voters on a massive scale — which we have previously rated  False . It also claims that such fraud is committed only by Democrats, which we also have rated  False . Groups that research fake videos and media outlets wrote that the videos the FBI warned about were manufactured by the Russians, however the U.S. federal government had not confirmed that as of midday Nov. 3. The group Antibot4navalny, which investigates Russian disinformation, wrote Nov. 2  on X , ""We confidently attribute both of the videos referred to by @FBI as belonging to Matryoshka, a Russian state influence operation, which is ongoing since Sept 2023."" The account is manned by an anonymous group of volunteers and has been quoted by several mainstream news outlets in 2024 including  The Associated Press ,  NBC News  and  The New York Times . The group’s name refers to Alexei A. Navalny, a Russian opposition leader who died in a Russian prison earlier this year. BBC reported  that the videos described by the FBI match those that are part of more than 300 that BBC has found since the start of 2024. ""The videos use convincing graphics and text to look like content from US government agencies as well as more than 50 news organisations — including the BBC, France 24 and Fox News,"" the BBC wrote. ""The videos have been posted online nearly every day for months and have recently focused on the US election, including clips promoting false claims about Harris and messages about unrest and ‘civil war.’"" CheckFirst, an online analytics company based in Finland, told the BBC that it linked the operation to Russia, tracking the network behind the videos to a Russian marketing agency and a Russian IP address. An Internet Protocol address is a numeric designation that identifies a device’s location on the internet. If federal officials had arrested groups for rigging mail-in ballots, that information would have eventually appeared publicly in charges filed in federal court. Such news also likely would have been addressed by state and local law enforcement and election officials. Law enforcement disclose  voter   fraud charges  to show that they take such allegations, when they are legitimate, seriously. The FBI, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Director of National Intelligence have said that Russian actors manufactured  videos about  people ripping up ballots in Pennsylvania ; falsely depicting individuals  claiming to be from Haiti  and voting illegally in Georgia; and stating Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff were paid  $500,000 to tip off Sean ""Diddy"" Combs about a police raid. ""This Russian activity is part of Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans,"" the federal agencies said, warning that similar efforts will continue through Election Day and beyond.

politifact,“Joe Rogan says he will not be voting for Trump after having him on the podcast.”,"Joe Rogan, the influential podcaster who recently interviewed Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump, hadn’t announced who he’s voting for in the 2024 election as of early afternoon Nov. 3.

We've updated the headline of this story. The story itself remains changed. Influential podcaster Joe Rogan recently hosted former President Donald Trump for a nearly  three-hour interview  that touched on everything from whether there is life on Mars (Trump says it’s possible), to Trump’s consistent windmill hatred (a ""bird cemetery"") and Trump’s greatest mistake in the White House (hiring disloyal people, Trump said). What didn’t come up: who Rogan was voting for. But that didn’t stop a social media user from saying Rogan announced that he wouldn’t be supporting Trump.

We found no evidence Rogan made any such announcement as of early afternoon Nov. 3. During the Oct. 26 Trump-Rogan interview, Trump asked Rogan to endorse his candidacy. But Rogan laughed off the suggestion. ""You cannot be voting for Kamala. Kamala. You’re not a Kamala person. I know you,"" Trump said. Rogan has not publicly declared support for Trump. In 2020, Rogan supported  Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., for president. After it became clear Sanders would lose the primary to Joe Biden, Rogan said he would  rather  vote for Trump than Biden in 2020. In the end, though, Rogan said he voted for Libertarian Party candidate Jo Jorgensen. ""I voted Libertarian,""  Rogan said in 2020 . ""I voted Jo Jorgensen. I knew she didn't have a shot. Legalizing drugs. I knew California was going to Biden no matter what and I couldn't. I was looking at the whole thing like 'what is this?'"" In August, Rogan praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who then was still running for president as an independent, saying Kennedy was the only candidate who does not ""gaslight"" the public. ""For the record, this isn't an endorsement.This is me saying that I like RFK Jr. as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence.

Colorado conservative activist and podcaster Joe Oltmann claims he heard Coomer speaking on an ""antifa conference call"" before the 2020 election telling participants he ""made sure"" former President Donald Trump wouldn’t win the election.     Oltmann has provided no evidence of the 2020 allegation, and Coomer is suing Oltmann for defamation.","Ahead of Election Day, former President Donald Trump’s supporters are resharing an unproven 2020 claim that a high-ranking Dominion Voting Systems employee told antifa members he ""made sure"" Trump wouldn’t win. ""Don’t worry about the election, Trump’s not gonna win. I made f-----g sure of that!"" says a Nov. 1 Instagram  post . The post attributes the quote to Eric Coomer, identified as Dominion’s director of strategy and security. The post also says Coomer made the statement while ""talking on an antifa conference call.""  Other text on the post says, ""(Repost) if you don’t trust Dominion voting machines and want paper ballots instead,"" and its caption says, in part, ""More than ever we must rise up for the final battle!!

(Read more about  our partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Nearly identical images also are being shared on Facebook and X. They include no indication that this allegation originated in 2020. This claim is unproven and is the subject of a defamation lawsuit. A judge fined the person who originally made the claim $1,000 a day for failing to produce evidence to corroborate the allegation. That fine is currently on hold pending an appeal. On Nov. 9, 2020, nearly a week after Election Day, Colorado conservative activist Joe Oltmann claimed he had been able to listen in on an ""antifa conference call"" before the election during which a man named Eric from Dominion promised Trump wouldn’t win. Oltmann referred to him as ""the Dominion guy."" ""They're talking on this call and he responds, and I'm paraphrasing this, right. ... ‘Don't worry about the election. Trump is not going to win. I made effing sure of that. Ha ha.’ And everyone's like, ‘Yeah.’ And then somebody else responds ‘effing right,’"" Oltmann said on his podcast, the Conservative Daily. Trump allies and pro-Trump cable news networks such as  One America News  and  Newsmax   amplified Oltmann’s claim. PolitiFact has found  no credible evidence  that Dominion’s machines affected any vote tallies, and our reporting found Dominion Voting Systems was used only in a few counties that experienced minor problems which were quickly resolved. Those problems were the result of either human error or temporary malfunctions. Republicans and Democrats who run elections also say there was no  vote-rigging using Dominion systems . Dominion Voting Systems was the subject of many  debunked claims  during and after the 2020 election. The company won a  $787 million settlement  against Fox News for repeatedly airing the false claims. Coomer, who was Dominion’s director of product strategy and security during the 2020 election, did post anti-Trump comments on his Facebook page in 2016. Oltmann found the comments and aired them on his podcast. ""I don’t give a damn if you're friend, family or random acquaintance,"" Coomer wrote in one post. ""(If you) pull the lever, mark an oval, touch the screen for that carnival barker ... UNFRIEND ME NOW."" Coomer  told The New York Times  in 2021 that the Facebook posts were authentic. But he said he never participated in an antifa conference call and never said the things Oltmann claimed he did. ""I did not participate in a scheme to rig votes,"" Coomer said in a court  sworn statement . ""I did not participate in an Antifa conference call or boast about my supposed ability to rig the election. Such conduct is antithetical to my belief system and would constitute criminal conduct."" Coomer filed a defamation lawsuit against OItmann and others who amplified the claim. Oltmann has yet to provide evidence about the ""antifa conference call"" or how he gained access to the meeting. He has never provided details about the person who gave him access to Coomer’s private Facebook account,  USA Today  reported in September. Oltmann also has yet to provide any evidence corroborating that Coomer said the things Oltmann has claimed. A judge in the defamation case ruled in September 2024 that Oltmann owes Coomer $1,000 a day for as long as he continues to withhold evidence of his claims of election rigging,  Colorado Politics  reported. In October, the court agreed to put the fines on hold pending an appeal. Newsmax also has  retracted its claims  about Coomer. ""Newsmax has found no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so,"" a 2021 Newsmax statement said.

Los funcionarios dijeron que la votante del condado Laurel que inicialmente tuvo el problema pudo emitir su voto con una boleta marcada correctamente con los candidatos deseados.","¿Está sucediendo algo sospechoso con las máquinas de votación en Kentucky? Eso es lo que publicaciones falsas en redes sociales quieren que creas.  Una  publicación en Instagram  del 31 de octubre compartió un video de una persona intentando repetidamente seleccionar los nombres del expresidente Donald Trump y el senador de Ohio JD Vance, para presidente y vicepresidente en las elecciones de 2024. El votante que usaba la máquina de votación intentó hacer esta selección tocando con el dedo la pequeña casilla de verificación en la esquina superior izquierda de un texto que presentaba los nombres de Trump y Vance. Luego de varios intentos, la persona en vez parece seleccionar la candidatura democrática de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris y el gobernador de Minnesota, Tim Walz.  ""Anda circulando un video de un ciudadano estadounidense tratando de votar por Trump, pero el sistema no lo dejaba! Que opinan sobre esto?"",  dice  la publicación en Instagram.  Otras publicaciones  similares   tanto   en inglés  como en español señalan que el incidente sucedió en Kentucky.  ""ALERTA: Máquinas de votación en Kentucky no permiten a los votantes seleccionar a Trump"", dice una  publicación  de América TeVé en Miami del 1 de noviembre en Instagram. La presentadora dijo ""hasta el momento no hemos visto las autoridades de Kentucky dar algún tipo de declaraciones pero yo me imagino que en las próximas horas tendrán que decir exactamente que es lo que está pasando"".

""Con toda transparencia, después de varios minutos de intentar recrear el escenario, ocurrió"", Brown  escribió  en una publicación en Facebook. ""Esto se logró marcando un área entre las cajas.

Russell Coleman, fiscal general de Kentucky y republicano,  publicó  en X que la oficina del Departamento de Investigaciones Criminales respondió rápidamente a la queja del condado Laurel. Los detectives del departamento recomendaron que el secretario del condado cambiará la máquina de votación. ""Todos los votantes de Kentucky pueden tener confianza en que nuestras elecciones son seguras y cualquier problema potencial se abordará rápidamente"",  escribió  Coleman en X. Brown  explicó  en Facebook que la máquina de votación en el video viral es un dispositivo marca boletas, el cual marca una boleta en blanco con las selecciones que los votantes marcan en la pantalla. Los votantes pueden revisar sus selecciones antes de entregar sus boletas.  Si los votantes están satisfechos con sus elecciones, pueden imprimir la boleta completa y colocarla en el escáner. Si los votantes cometen un error o hay un error con la boleta, pueden ""anular"" esa boleta y recibir otra. La ley de Kentucky permite a los votantes anular hasta dos boletas por elección, Brown  escribió  en Facebook. Brown también  compartió  un video de un funcionario del condado probando la misma máquina de votación utilizada en el video. El funcionario intentó tocar la pequeña casilla de verificación, como lo había hecho la persona en el video viral, pero no funcionó. Cuando el funcionario tocó el centro del nombre del candidato, la casilla se volvió verde para mostrar que estaba seleccionado. ""Estos dispositivos para marcar las boletas están diseñados para que el votante toque dentro de toda la caja con el nombre de los candidatos. En el video publicado se nos puede ver yendo entre los nombres de un lado a otro sin problemas"", Brown  escribió . ""No hubo quejas sobre problemas con el dispositivo antes, y tampoco desde que volvió a estar en servicio"". Brown y el secretario de estado de Kentucky, Michael Adams, un republicano, confirmaron que la votante que tuvo el problema pudo emitir su voto, el cual estaba correctamente marcado e impreso con los candidatos que ella había elegido.

James Young, ex administrador electoral de Kentucky y registrado como republicano, hizo eco de esto,  publicando  en X que el video viral no mostraba ninguna actividad fraudulenta o ""cambio de votos"".

politifact,"If a ballot has a small dot in the box for Vice President Kamala Harris, “any other box filled in, will be void.”","Kentucky election officials said they had received no reports as of Nov. 4 of a premarked ballot.      A small dot does not constitute a voter’s selection under state rules, and it would not invalidate a proper marking in another candidate’s selection area, election officials said.      Voters can circle their preferred candidate if they accidentally mark too many boxes, and in-person voters will be notified if they try to vote for more than one candidate.","Social media users are claiming a discrepancy with Kentucky ballots will invalidate a vote for anyone other than Vice President Kamala Harris.  A photo of a Kentucky ballot shared in a Nov. 3 Facebook  post  appears to have a printed dot in the box next to Harris’ name, and social media users claimed a vote for any other candidate ""will be void"" because of the dot. The social media posts instructed voters to request new ballots if they see similar marks.  Although the photo shows a Kentucky ballot, social media users in other states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Alabama, shared the same image with the same text and the same warning.  The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) In a Nov. 4  statement , the Kentucky State Board of Elections said neither it nor the state attorney general’s office had received any reports or complaints of mail-in absentee ballots or early in-person absentee ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4. Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams oversees the Board of Elections, which includes four Democratic and four Republican members. ""As no one has presented a pre-marked ballot to election administrators or law enforcement, the claim that at least one ballot may have had a pre-printed mark in Kentucky, currently only exists in the vacuum of social media,"" the board said in the statement.  If a ballot did have the mark shown in the photo, it would be unlikely to be counted as a vote, state officials said.  Whether tabulators would read the dot shown in the photo as a vote depends on the local equipment’s settings, Taylor Brown, the general counsel for the Kentucky State Board of Elections, said. Generally, Brown said, the machine settings would have to be very sensitive to detect a dot of that size. Administrative rules  in Kentucky define what types of marks constitute a vote, and a small dot is not among the definitions in the law. If a ballot is flagged as having too many selections for one office — which is called an overvote — county officials also have leeway to determine voter intent. If a mail-in ballot had a full box filled in and a small dot in a different box, county officials could interpret the full box as the voter’s selection, Brown said. ""The law says the two selections have to be ‘similarly marked’ (to constitute an overvote), and a small, single dot is not recognized as one of the markings that constitutes a vote,"" Brown said. Also, when voting by mail, if voters mark more than one candidate choice in ink, they can circle their preferred choice and the vote will be counted, the Kentucky board said. Mailed absentee ballots come with an instruction sheet that explains that process. When voting in person, either early or on Election Day, Kentucky voters can choose to spoil their ballot and receive a new, clean ballot, up to two times. If a voter tries to cast a vote where more candidates are selected for an office than allowed, the ballot scanner will flag the ballot as including an overvote and the voter will be allowed to cast a new ballot.  Outside Kentucky, similar systems are in place to notify voters of an overvote and examine voter intent when counting votes. The 2002  Help America Vote Act  requires that voting systems notify voters if they select more candidates than allowed and give them a chance to correct their ballots. Each state has its own process for  interpreting voter intent  and scanning ballot selections, Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told PolitiFact. In many states, if a ballot includes both a small mark and a selection box that’s fully filled in for the same office, the vote would be counted for the fully marked candidate. Once a mail-in ballot is separated from its envelope, the voter is unknown, making it harder to rectify overvotes of mail-in ballots. Election workers look for discrepancies when they preprocess mail-in ballots, and they ""treat it in accordance with their jurisdiction’s procedures,"" Cohen said.  If an overvote occurs and it is unclear which candidate the voter intended to select, no vote is counted for that office. Our ruling Facebook posts said If a ballot has a small dot in the box for Harris, ""any other box filled in, will be void.""  Kentucky officials said they had received no reports or complaints of ballots with preprinted marks in the candidate selection fields as of Nov. 4. The mark shown in the photo does not constitute a vote under state law, Kentucky officials said. If a ballot included a small mark such as that and a selection for another candidate that was clearly filled out, the clearly marked vote would be counted.  We rate the claim False.",false,Facebook posts,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/04/facebook-posts/no-a-stray-dot-on-a-ballot-wont-invalidate-a-vote/,"Elections, Facebook Fact-checks, Facebook posts"

In 2022, the Wisconsin Elections Commission fined him for making frivolous election complaints.","In an election-focused group on Elon Musk’s X platform, a man made what he described as ""bombshell"" allegations about the U.S. Postal Service.   ""The United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots!"" Peter Bernegger wrote in  an Oct. 27 post . ""They are hiding the evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud - by not allowing the evidence to be created in the first place."" In a nearly 400-word post, Bernegger accused the Postal Service of improperly directed post offices ""to NOT send absentee mail-in ballots to central sort. But instead take them to the election clerks."" He said that meant ""no electronic ballot images are being created,"" which he argued amounted to intentionally hiding fraud.  Bernegger, based in Wisconsin, has rejected the 2020 election’s results. Since 2020, he has filed numerous lawsuits against local election offices, accusing them of fraud while promoting his litigation and false election fraud claims online, The Guardian  reported . The Wisconsin Elections Commission in 2022  fined Bernegger  more than $2,400 for making frivolous election complaints.  In February, Wisconsin prosecutors  accused Bernegger of falsifying  a subpoena for an election-related case, and he was charged with ""simulating legal process,"" a felony. The criminal case against him  continues .  Bernegger shared his post to the ""Election Integrity"" Community that Musk’s Political Action Committee created on X. Since it was established Oct. 21, the group has amassed over 60,000 members, many of whom circulate inaccurate election narratives, including  multiple   claims   we have fact-checked .  We contacted Bernegger on X and by email through his organization,  Election Watch , but received no response. (Screenshot from X) Bernegger’s post provided no evidence to support his claim. He included an image of a letter from the Postal Service that said the agency found no documents that would satisfy his Freedom of Information Act records request for ""all the electronic images of all absentee mail-in ballots"" sent by municipal and county clerks in Wisconsin from Sept. 17 to Oct. 14. He also attributed the alleged changes to  Amber McReynolds , the U.S. Postal Service’s Board of Governors’ vice chair and a President Joe Biden appointee.  We searched using Google and the Nexis news archive, and found no credible reports or information supporting the claim that McReynolds advocated for mail ballots delivery changes in 2024. We also found no credible reports that the Postal Service had made changes to its procedures for mail ballots.  U.S. Postal Service spokesperson Martha Johnson told PolitiFact that the Postal Service has not ""recently changed the delivery method of absentee ballots"" as the posts claim. The Postal Service has used the same procedures for previous general elections, she said.  As it has in past election years, the Postal Service on Oct. 21  launched  what it  describes as  ""extraordinary measures"" that Johnson said are ""designed to accelerate the delivery of ballots mailed close to Election Day."" The measures include additional collections, extra deliveries, special sorting plans on processing equipment and a different way of handling mailed ballots, Johnson said. ""Under normal operations, any piece of mail, including an absentee ballot, is handled and postmarked at the processing facility closest to its originating post office and, depending on how far it is going, will be handled again at one or more processing facilities closer to its (destination) post office,"" Johnson said.  Under the special election year process, however, mailed ballots addressed to a local or nearby election office ""will bypass the processing operation and will instead be postmarked at the local unit and delivered to the election office,"" Johnson said. ""This is consistent with our practice in previous general elections.""  The agency’s  2020 press release  used the same ""extraordinary measures"" language. We also found a more detailed  October 2020 memorandum  that detailed similar provisions, including one authorizing local post offices to postmark and deliver ballots to boards of elections ""rather than the ballots being placed into the automation flow."" A  September 2022  memo said the agency would employ the same ""extraordinary measures"" as it had in 2020.  A mail-in official ballot for the 2024 general election in the United States is shown Oct. 8, 2024, in Pennsylvania. (AP) Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, said the special procedures for ballots are ""well known"" and ""regularly implemented"" among Postal Service offices and personnel across the country.  ""The extraordinary measures process is established for every general election, and was not done out of the blue,"" she said.  In 2024, the Postal Service’s ""extraordinary measures"" for election mail started earlier, but they ""are the same or mostly the same"" as the measures in 2020 and 2022, said Amy Cohen, who works closely with state election officials nationwide as executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors.  Cohen added that although the measures mean some ballots don’t go to processing facilities, ""keeping election mail local helps it move faster through the system.""  If ballots bypass automated processing, the Postal Service may not generate electronic images of the ballot envelopes as it usually would as part of its  informed delivery  service, according to the agency’s website. Informed delivery is an opt-in Postal Service program that sends image previews of incoming Postal Service mail. Those images, however, ""are only provided for letter-sized mailpieces that are processed through USPS's automated equipment,""  the Postal Service website  says.  But there’s no evidence that a lack of images signals fraud.  Brenden Donahue, U.S. assistant postal inspector in charge at the United States Postal Inspection Service, told PolitiFact it does not threaten election security when digital images of ballot envelopes aren’t created.  ""The Postal Service utilizes a variety of robust measures, processes, and procedures to ensure the safe, secure, and timely delivery of our nation’s Election Mail, including ballots,"" Donahue said. ""The capture of mail piece images are not one of those standard measures, processes, or procedures."" Experts told PolitiFact that the Postal Service works alongside election officials across the U.S. and has built on its experience and honed its processes over time.  Michael Alvarez, political and computational social science at Caltech and co-director of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, said he has recently enabled webinar conversations with numerous election officials who’ve discussed mail ballots and the Postal Service. During those discussions, those election officials raised ""no concerns"" about ""any changes in the USPS delivery of mail ballots,"" Alvarez said. An X post said ""the United States Postal Service recently changed the delivery method of absentee mail-in ballots"" to hide ""the evidence of absentee mail-in ballot fraud."" Close to Election Day, the Postal Service handles mailed ballots differently than other mail, but this procedure isn’t new. Election experts and a Postal Service spokesperson said that the agency has made similar changes to ensure prompt delivery of election mail in previous elections including in 2020 and 2022.  A Postal Service spokesperson rebutted claims that the agency’s special measures for election mail signal fraud, saying that the measures intend to speed ballot mail delivery. We rate these claims False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report. RELATED:   Video shows Haitians who claim they’re voting for Harris in multiple Georgia counties.

Es un video que las autoridades sospechan que procede de actores de influencia rusos que intentan sembrar el caos antes de las elecciones. Este sigue un patrón que hemos visto en  otros videos recientes . El video apareció el 31 de octubre en  varias   publicaciones  en X en  español  y en  inglés . El video muestra a un hombre que parece estar en un vehículo con otras personas. El hombre dice en inglés que son haitianos que llegaron a Estados Unidos hace seis meses y ya tienen la ciudadanía estadounidense.  ""Vamos a votar por Kamala Harris"", dice el hombre en el video. ""Ayer votamos en el condado Gwinnett y hoy lo haremos en el de Fulton"". Ambos condados están en Georgia, un estado clave. La cámara gira para mostrar al hombre sosteniendo cuatro licencias de conducir, con lo que parece ser la misma foto en todos ellos. Luego aparece otra mano, sosteniendo otras cuatro licencias de conducir. El segundo juego de licencias de conducir tiene una foto diferente.  ""Tenemos todos nuestros documentos, licencias de conducir"", dice el hombre. ""Invitamos a todos los haitianos a venir a América y traer a sus familias"". Al fondo se ve una gorra de ""Harris Walz"". (Captura de pantalla de la publicación en X). ""Haitianos afirman haber llegado a EEUU hace solo 6 meses y ya tienen documentos de legalidad que les permite votar en Georgia"", dice una  publicación en X  del 31 de octubre. ""No solo eso, también afirman que ya votaron en un distrito y se dirigen a votar en otro. Es alarmante"".  La "" comunidad de integridad electoral "" en X, lanzada por el comité de acción política de Elon Musk, propietario de X, para que los miembros ""compartan posibles incidentes de fraude electoral"", también  compartió la publicación . Esta comunidad ya cuenta con más de 60,000 miembros. Un indicio de que el video es dudoso: ¿por qué iba alguien a admitir un fraude electoral ante una cámara mostrando su información personal? Cuando se examinan detenidamente los detalles, se perciben más falsedades. Las autoridades desacreditaron la afirmación y la vincularon a actores de influencia rusos. En un  comunicado conjunto del 1 de noviembre , la oficina del Director de Inteligencia Nacional, el Buró Federal de Investigaciones de EE.UU. (FBI, por sus siglas en inglés) y la Agencia de Seguridad de Infraestructura y Ciberseguridad dijo que ""actores de influencia rusos fabricaron un video reciente en el que aparecían falsamente individuos que decían ser de Haití y votaban ilegalmente en varios condados de Georgia"". El comunicado dijo que ese juicio se basa en la información de la comunidad de inteligencia y en ""actividades anteriores de otros agentes de influencia rusos, incluidos videos y otras actividades de desinformación"". El secretario de Estado de Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, emitió un  comunicado  el 31 de octubre en el que calificaba el video de ""falso"" y de ""ejemplo de desinformación dirigida"". ""Es probable que se trate de una interferencia extranjera que intenta sembrar la discordia y el caos a vísperas de las elecciones presidenciales de 2024"", decía el comunicado. Raffensperger dijo que la agencia federal de ciberseguridad está investigando el asunto, e instó a Musk, y a los responsables de otras plataformas de redes sociales a retirar el video.  ""Es obviamente falso y parte de un esfuerzo de desinformación. Es probable que sea una producción de las fábricas de trolls rusas"", dijo Raffensperger. En el video en redes sociales, los nombres de las identificaciones eran legibles: Raoul Sylvan y Jacques Benoit. Sus fechas de nacimiento también son visibles. Cuando PolitiFact realizó búsquedas utilizando estos nombres y fechas de nacimiento en los condados Gwinnett y Fulton, no apareció ningún resultado en la  página web de votantes de Georgia .  Las direcciones que figuran en los permisos de conducir están en Lawrenceville y Duluth, ambos en el condado Gwinnett. Hany Farid, profesor de la Universidad de California en Berkeley, especializado en análisis forense digital, dijo a PolitiFact que el video no tenía signos de generación o manipulación por inteligencia artificial, y que parece ""simplemente escenificado"".  ""Si ves el video a resolución completa, puedes ver los ojos (de) la persona que habla escaneando de un lado a otro como si estuviera leyendo de un guión"", dijo Farid. ""Se trata de una falsificación barata — y bastante perezosa"". Siwei Lyu, profesor de la Universidad de Buffalo y director del laboratorio de forense digital, coincidió con Farid diciendo que el video no presenta marcadores significativos de ""deepfake"". Los videos ""deepfake"" son sofisticados, generados por computadora y dan la impresión que alguien está diciendo o haciendo algo, aun cuando esa persona no dijo o hizo eso. ""Es probable que se trate de un video real, pero puede que la historia no lo sea"", dijo Lyu. Darren Linvill, profesor de comunicación de la Universidad de Clemson que rastrea la desinformación rusa,  dijo en X  que el video tiene ""varios sellos distintivos de la campaña rusa, Storm-1516"".  Se cree que la misma campaña está detrás del video viral de un trabajador electoral que supuestamente rompe boletas en el condado Bucks, en Pensilvania. Calificamos esa afirmación como  Ridícula y Falsa .  En un correo electrónico a PolitiFact, Linvill dijo que su equipo detecta las narrativas de Storm-1516 basándose en su enfoque narrativo, estilo y red de producción y distribución. ""Esta, por ejemplo, ataca la integridad electoral, un foco de desinformación rusa durante muchos años"", dijo Linvill. Él dijo que, según el historial de Storm-1516 de contratar actores de África Occidental, es probable que las personas del video también sean inmigrantes de África Occidental reclutados en San Petersburgo, Rusia. Linville dijo anteriormente que la persona que aparecía en el video sobre la destrucción de las boletas electorales del condado Bucks también parecía tener acento de África Occidental y probablemente procedía de la misma zona. Linvill dijo que su equipo rastrea una red de páginas web prorrusas y cuentas de redes sociales que Storm-1516 es ""conocida por usar"". Dijo que en este caso, la campaña utilizó una cuenta X llamada ""Alphafox"" que Linvill describió como ""un hombre en Massachusetts que han utilizado antes"". NewsGuard , una empresa que rastrea la desinformación en Internet, también encontró que la publicación de ""Alphafox"" — ahora no disponible pero  archivada aquí  — fue la versión más temprana de la narrativa. Los haitianos han sido  objetivo de la desinformación  agravada por las afirmaciones de que los haitianos en Springfield, Ohio, se comían las mascotas de los residentes. El expresidente Donald Trump y el candidato republicano a la vicepresidencia, el senador de Ohio JD Vance, amplificaron estas afirmaciones falsas.

But the posts are wrong about how overseas active-duty military service members receive and cast their votes.  The Pentagon has no role in sending absentee ballots. Each state is responsible for managing their election processes, a Pentagon spokesperson said in an email to PolitiFact. (Screenshot from Instagram) Military service members and their spouses must request absentee ballots from their home states to vote. They can do so through the Defense Department’s  Federal Voting Assistance Program .  The program provides  voting assistance  for service members, their families and other people living overseas. Voters can  use the site  to register to vote, request state ballots and navigate election dates and deadlines. Webb’s  X post , which was tagged with a community note pointing out that the Pentagon doesn’t send ballots, provides more context behind the claim. Webb  responded  to the note by pointing to an  Oct. 30 letter  sent by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., and Mike Waltz R-Fla., to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The representatives said in the letter that active-duty service members had raised concerns about the Pentagon’s ""inadequate education"" on how to vote and that when some members whose mail ballots did not arrive in time requested a federal write-in ballot, they were told the base had run out. Webb, in  another X post , said the Pentagon is responsible for providing those ballots. But that misunderstands how the write-in ballot option works.  Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder said at a  Nov. 4 briefing  that the Pentagon has a ""robust education program in terms of getting the word out on how service members and their families"" can vote. If a service member’s absentee ballot sent by the state doesn’t arrive in time, members can use the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot available online as a backup, Ryder said. A service member using that ballot doesn’t need to request it from their military base. They can  print the ballots out  themselves from the Federal Voting Assistance Program website. The program’s  website  on Nov. 5 included information on how to access the backup ballot. Instagram posts claimed the Pentagon ""failed to send absentee ballots to active military service members before the election."" But the Pentagon doesn’t send absentee ballots to overseas members.

Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson initially said during an Oct. 28 press briefing that the programming issue was ""nationwide.""

Michigan election officials said this problem is fixable and won’t prevent voters from casting ballots with their chosen candidates.

But some social media users misconstrued this as proof of widespread interference in the 2024 election.

""According to (Benson’s) office, this ‘programming issue’ CANNOT be fixed, and voters are being forced to deal with it,"" the X user  wrote . This X post received millions of views. The Michigan Department of State said in an Oct. 25  statement  that the programming snag has made voting more inconvenient for some voters, but it hasn’t prevented any voters from casting ballots. The problem is specific to voters using Dominion’s voter assist terminals, or VATs, which are designed to help voters with disabilities, the department said. All Michigan voting locations are required to have voter assist terminals, but not all of the state’s voting machines are designed by Dominion. Sixty-five of Michigan’s 83 counties  use Dominion voting equipment . If a voter using this type of machine selects the ""straight-party"" option to vote for all candidates of one party, but then decides to vote for a candidate of a different party, the voter will receive an error message, the state department said. To fix the problem, ""the voter will need to go back and de-select their straight-party selection and vote for candidates in the races individually or vote straight party without splitting their ticket,"" the state department said. Dominion  issued  a statement Oct. 25 with similar instructions for Michigan voters using the voter assist terminals. ""Voters seeking to vote for a single party for all contests can use the straight-party option,"" Dominion said. ""Voters seeking to split their ticket by choosing one or more candidates of a different political party should be advised not to select the straight-party voting option."" Dominion said in an Oct. 30  statement  that this programming error was not happening with voter assist terminals in other states that have straight-ticket voting. The voting equipment company said the Michigan secretary of state’s office  updated its website  Oct. 30 to clarify that the problem was specific to Michigan. In Michigan, voters typically have the option to vote straight-party but then override their party selection for individual races, the state department said. Voters will be able to review their selections before printing their ballots and putting them in the scanner for tabulation, the state department said. The state department said it’s impossible to fix the voter assist terminals’ programming this close to Election Day, but the problem will be corrected for future elections. ""Although the issue will not stop people from voting or making their preferred selections, and it will not change anyone’s votes, it will make the process more inconvenient for some voters using the VATs,"" the state department said.

politifact,"A Nov. 5  ballot scanning error in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, shows ""the election steal is happening.""","Voting machines in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, were unable to scan ballots on Election Day morning because of a ballot printing error.     Ballots were still being accepted and the time to vote was extended. County officials resolved the issue by the afternoon on Election Day.     There’s no evidence the problems were an intentional move to suppress votes.","Ballot scanning issues in one Pennsylvania county led to delays and voter confusion on Election Day, leading some to speculate about potential voter fraud. County and state officials  confirmed on Election Day  morning that Cambria County, Pennsylvania, vote tabulating machines were unable to scan ballots because of technical issues. Later that afternoon, county officials said the issue was caused by a ballot printing error, which made the ballots unreadable by tabulators, according to local NBC affiliate  WJAC-TV .  The issue was corrected by Tuesday afternoon, WJAC reported, and the county’s polling places were supplied with new ballots that were able to be tabulated and processed by the machines.  Before the issue was resolved, voters were still able to fill out paper ballots and securely cast them.  The ballots that were cast before the issue was resolved will be hand counted, Cambria County Solicitor Ron Repak told WJAC. Voters who used an electronic ballot marking device, rather than filling out a paper ballot, also had no problem casting their ballot, local officials said. The concern led some social media users to claim the delays were evidence of election fraud. One  X post  said, ""The election steal is happening,"" pointing to the reported issues. The Pennsylvania Department of State wrote  Nov. 5  on X it was aware of the issues and was working to resolve them. The department said voters were still casting paper ballots. ""The Department of State is in contact with county officials in Cambria County,"" Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson Amy Gulli told PolitiFact. ""Voters are continuing to vote by paper ballot, in accordance with normal operations, while the county resolves the issue with in-precinct scanning."" With more than 3,000 counties across the United States, each with different systems for recording and counting votes, technical issues sometimes happen. But there’s no evidence the problems are evidence of an ""election steal,"" as some social media users claimed.  Around 69,800 people voted in Cambria County in  2020 , which former President Donald Trump won by 37 percentage points. The county, about 60 miles east of Pittsburgh, has a  population  of about 133,500. A Pennsylvania judge  approved a petition  from the Cambria County Board of Elections to extend voting two hours, to 10 p.m., because of the issues. The extension applies only to Cambria County. The malfunction ""caused voter confusion, long lines of voters, and many individuals left the polling locations without casting a ballot,""  according to the petition .  Repak said in a Nov. 5 statement that votes cast during the period when the tabulating machines failed were securely accepted, stored and counted,  WJAC  reported.  ""There is a process in place for issues of this nature,"" Repak said. ""All completed ballots will be accepted, secured, and counted by the Board of Elections."" Cambria County  uses voting systems  from Election Systems & Software, known as ES&S, one of five approved vendors in the state.  Before the problem was resolved, ES&S spokesperson Katina Granger told PolitiFact the company was working with the county to address it. Granger described the scanning problem as stemming from ""an issue with the printed ballot.""  ""This morning, voters after hand marking their ballot were instructed to place their ballots into the auxiliary bin of the ballot box,"" Granger said. ""These ballots will all be counted after polls close."" Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley in an  X post  encouraged affected voters to stay in line and fill out and deliver their ballots. The Republican Party of Pennsylvania intervened to support the county’s petition to extend voting hours, according to a Republican National Committee press release. The Cambria County tabulating machine issues caused delays and confusion at voting sites, but ballots were still being accepted and the time to vote was extended. Local officials prepare for technical issues, and officials said all ballots will be counted.

Bush 36 days after polls closed — and only after the U.S. Supreme Court ended a Florida recount. Yet, public expectations can be high: One social media post expressed dismay that Nevada election officials will ""count ballots three days past the election,"" saying that would allow them to know how many ballots ""they need in order to push Kamala Harris over the top.""

Nevada’s election must be certified at the local and county level within 10 days of the election and at the state level by the fourth Tuesday of November.

The organization also does not pay people for getting someone else to register to vote or vote.

Pero las publicaciones están equivocadas sobre cómo reciben y emiten su voto los miembros del servicio militar activo en el extranjero.  El Pentágono no interviene en el envío de votos por correo. Cada estado es responsable de gestionar sus procesos electorales, dijo un portavoz del Pentágono en un correo electrónico a PolitiFact. Para votar, los militares y sus cónyuges deben solicitar el voto en ausencia a sus estados de origen. Pueden hacerlo a través del  Programa Federal de Asistencia para Votar  del Departamento de Defensa.  El programa ofrece  ayuda para votar  a los miembros del servicio militar, sus familias y otras personas que viven en el extranjero. Los votantes pueden  utilizar la página web  para registrarse para votar, solicitar boletas estatales y consultar las fechas y plazos de las elecciones. La  publicación en X  de Webb fue etiquetada con una nota de la comunidad — el enfoque de colaboración colectiva de la plataforma para hacer frente a la desinformación. Esta nota  señalaba que el Pentágono no envía boletas y proporcionaba más contexto. Webb  respondió  a la nota señalando a una  carta del 30 de octubre  enviada por los representantes republicanos de Florida Brian Mast y Mike Waltz junto con Bill Huizenga, republicano de Michigan, al secretario de Defensa Lloyd Austin. En la carta, los representantes dijeron que los miembros del servicio militar activo estaban preocupados por la ""educación inadecuada"" del Pentágono sobre cómo votar. También dijeron que cuando algunos miembros pidieron una boleta federal de voto en ausencia por escrito porque sus boletas de voto por correo no llegaron a tiempo, les dijeron que la base se había quedado sin. Webb, en  otra publicación en X , dijo que el Pentágono es responsable de proporcionar esas boletas. Pero eso no explica cómo funciona la opción del voto en ausencia por escrito.  El secretario de prensa del Pentágono, general de división Pat Ryder, dijo en una  sesión informativa el 4 de noviembre  que el Pentágono tiene un ""sólido programa de educación en términos de difundir la información sobre cómo los miembros del servicio y sus familias"" pueden votar. Si la boleta de voto en ausencia de un miembro del servicio que envía el estado no llega a tiempo, el miembro puede utilizar la  boleta federal de voto en ausencia por escrito  disponible en línea como un respaldo, dijo Ryder.

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said employees were reminded not to wear uniforms and insignia to avoid confusing voters.     Noncitizens are already prohibited from voting in federal elections.,"A viral and misleading Instagram video claimed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement leaders barred employees from wearing uniforms to the polls to avoid alarming noncitizens who were casting ballots. ""Just got word that in Arizona and in Pennsylvania … they have got word from their higher-ups, when they go to vote tomorrow, they are not allowed to wear their uniform or their badges,"" conservative commentator Ben Bergquam said in a  Nov. 5 Instagram video .  ""And they believe it’s because Kamala Harris and Joe Biden don’t want to intimidate illegal aliens voting,"" he added.  Bergquam  repeated  these claims in an interview that morning with Steve Bannon, a onetime adviser to former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. The Instagram video was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Threads and Instagram.) White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told PolitiFact the claim was false. First, noncitizens are  not eligible  to  vote  in federal elections. Noncitizens who vote face federal and state penalties including imprisonment and, if they are illegally in the country, deportation. Second, federal law  prohibits  armed and civil law enforcement activity at polling places, except when it is ""necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States."" This provision prevents immigration enforcement at polling locations.  Field directors and agents in charge reminded employees not to wear uniforms and other markings while they were voting, citing U.S. code.  ""Like all federal law enforcement officers, the agency’s officers and agents are prohibited by federal statute from taking enforcement actions at polling places,"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson Jeff Carter told PolitiFact. This is not the first time federal agencies have reminded employees about conduct during elections. In 2020, during Trump’s presidency, the Defense Department reminded military service members about the uniform policy. ""All members of the armed forces, including active-duty members, members of the reserve components not on active duty, and retired members are prohibited from wearing military uniforms at political campaign or election events,"" a  2020 department reminder  said. Federal law  prohibits  military service members from interfering in election processes. Some states, including  New York  and  Maryland , also bar civilians from wearing military-style clothes at polling places. The statement that ICE officials were told not to wear uniforms at the polls to not intimidate noncitizens voting contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Philadelphia city commissioners said in an emailed statement that the video was ""selectively edited."" And although the nonprofit said one of its staff members incorrectly said a person could vote with an ITIN, that does not align with the group’s practice or training.     Federal law requires voters be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections. A small number of municipalities nationwide permit noncitizen voting in local races, Philadelphia is not among them.","An election eve two-minute video made by a well-known conservative activist misleadingly claimed to have proof of illegal voting activity in the swing state of Pennsylvania. ""Philadelphia city commissioners’ office tells non-citizens they can vote if they are Philly residents,""  read a Nov. 4 X post  from O’Keefe Media Group, the creation of founder and former Project Veritas leader James O’Keefe. In the video, O’Keefe — who left Project Veritas in 2023 when its board  accused him  of spending donor funds on ""personal luxuries""  — said he was standing outside a Philadelphia city commissioners’ office, where people were early voting. Across the street, he said, was a gathering of people from Ceiba, a nonprofit promoting economic development in Latino communities. ""They are telling people to vote,"" O’Keefe said in the video, appearing to refer to people associated with Ceiba. ""They are telling people that all you need is what is called an (ITIN) number."" He then showed footage that he said showed an undercover reporter getting confirmation from the nonprofit and a county commissioner’s office worker that ""she can vote with nothing but an ITIN number"" and ""you only need to be a resident of Philadelphia.""  ""ITIN"" refers to an individual taxpayer identification number, a nine-digit number the Internal Revenue Service issues to people filing tax returns who are not U.S. citizens and who do not have or are not eligible for Social Security numbers. The video gained traction on X, with several leading conservatives, including conspiracy theorist  Alex Jones , amplifying it as an example of election misconduct.  ""This is the smoking gun of attempted election theft,"" Jones wrote.  ""BREAKING: PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION FRAUD!"" wrote another X user who  shared the post .  But this video does not show proof of noncitizen voting in the federal election. O’Keefe founded Project Veritas, a right-wing organization known for doing undercover reporting and using selectively edited videos. This video used a similar format. (O’Keefe was  sued in 2021  and, following a settlement earlier this year, apologized for falsely claiming a postal worker committed voter fraud.) Federal law requires voters be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and although a small number of municipalities nationwide permit  noncitizen voting in local races , Philadelphia is not among them. ""This report is incorrect and not supported at all by the facts,"" Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, wrote Nov. 4   on X,  responding to the O’Keefe video. ""Non-citizens are not eligible to vote in Philadelphia. A mail ballot provided by our office can only be counted after the voter verifies their ID, typically with a social security number or driver’s license number."" Spokesperson Kevin Feeley sent PolitiFact a statement from the Philadelphia City Commissioners that described the video as ""selectively edited"" and said it showed ""a staffer at one of our Satellite Elections offices explaining voter eligibility requirements."" ""Noncitizens may not legally register to vote or cast a ballot anywhere in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia,"" the spokesperson’s statement said. Ceiba also addressed the video,  writing  on Instagram that its organization was ""targeted by an organized group of individuals who recorded our staff, and falsely accused us of registering non-citizens to vote.""  In a second Instagram  statement , Ceiba added that one of its staff members incorrectly answered a question about whether ITINs can be used to vote. It said that does not align with its training or practice. ""We have addressed the matter and we will continue to uphold — as we always have — the integrity of our country’s voting system,"" the post said. ""Additionally, there is a system of checks and balances — with both mail ballots and in person voting that prevent a person from being able to vote using an ITIN."" Pennsylvania  voters who are voting for the first time in their election districts must show proof of identification, and an ITIN is not a valid  proof of identity . ""The ITIN, used to help noncitizens to pay their taxes, is a distinct number and it is impossible for someone to use it to register to vote,"" Ceiba’s Instagram statement said. As O’Keefe claimed Ceiba told people they could use ITIN numbers to vote, he showed a portion of a Spanish-language flier to the camera.

Just in case, PG&E has provided polling centers with generators.      In 2020, President Joe Biden won Solano, Lake and Santa Clara County where the affected polling stations are.","During our nationwide contest for power, did a California energy company pull the plug?  ""#Breaking: They shut off the power on Republican voters,"" a  user posted Nov. 5 on X,  ""Pacific Gas & Electric in California has shut off power in several ‘Republican’ areas.""  The  Pacific Gas & Electric Co. , aka PG&E, provides electrical power to about 16 million people in northern and central California. But the company has not unplugged voters on Election Day.  There is potential for an intentional power shut-off to prevent wildfires in high winds, but it is forecast to happen after the polls close. And voting centers have backup generators in case a shut-off becomes necessary.   (Screenshot of X post) In strong winds, live power lines falling down or knocking into dry vegetation can spark wildfires. So, if weather conditions merit it, utilities in California can be intentionally turned off to specific areas to reduce fire risk — this is called a  public safety power shut-off .  Because of expected low relative humidity, dryer vegetation and gusting winds on election night, the  criteria  for a public safety power shut-off, PG&E began notifying people on Nov. 3 about a potential public safety power shut-off the evening of Nov. 5.  PG&E announced the morning of  Nov. 5  that five polling locations, but no vote tabulation centers, fall within the potential shut-off’s scope.  Nevertheless, none of the public safety power shut-offs are expected to take place when voting is taking place, PG&E spokesperson Jeff Smith said. ""It’s continually under an evaluation"" because weather can shift, but the earliest forecast shut off is 9:30 p.m. and ""most of them are around 11 p.m.""  Although power shutoffs are expected after  polls close  at 8 p.m. PST in California, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" PG&E has provided backup generators to all the polling centers within the shutoff’s scope in case weather changes and the shut-off needs to happen earlier, Smith said. ""But as of now, there's no expectation that we would need to do that, and there's nothing forecast until after in person voting would be over,"" he said around 3:30 p.m. PST.  A 5 p.m. PST  press release  from PG&E said that ""At this time, PG&E has not received any reports of active power outages at any polling location in our service area. An outage was reported at a polling location in Santa Rosa, but the site backup generation and service was quickly restored. PG&E has dispatched an additional generator to that site.""  A related viral claim said there were "" 7,000+ Polling Locations Potentially Affected ,"" by the shut-off. But this  isn’t true , either. PG&E provides electricity to more than 7,000 polling stations, but only a few of them fall within the potential shut-off area.  As for the claim that this shut-off would affect only Republican voters, in  2020 Joe Biden won  all three counties within the scope of the shut-offs: Solano, Lake, and Santa Clara.  X users claimed that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. deliberately shut off power ""on Republican voters"" on Election Day.

Harris was referring to how people could say ""Merry Christmas"" to each other if Congress didn’t pass the DREAM Act, which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. The act would have provided a pathway to citizenship for some immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children,  according  to NBC News.  The DREAM Act’s first version was introduced in 2001, and during the last 20 years, at least 20 versions have been introduced in Congress. But so far none has passed,  according  to the American Immigration Council, an immigrant-rights advocacy group. The  2010 version of the bill  came closest to full passage when it passed the House of Representatives but fell just five votes short of the 60 needed to proceed in the Senate.  Harris made her remarks  after  Trump, as president, ordered in fall 2017 the phase out of  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, which permitted certain people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to live and work in the United States and temporarily protected them from deportation.  ""It is morally wrong, and when we all sing happy tunes and sing ""Merry Christmas"" and wish each other ""Merry Christmas."" These children are not going to have a Merry Christmas,"" Harris  says   during the 58-second video. ""How dare we speak ""Merry Christmas""? How dare we? They will not have a Merry Christmas, they don’t know if they will be here in a matter of days, weeks and months.""  NBC Latino posted Harris' quote on a 2017  X post , saying she was at a DREAM Act rally. PolitiFact couldn’t find the original video of Harris’ speech at the news conference. Harris also posted Dec. 20, 2017, on her Facebook an image of a person with a sign that says, ""I need to be able to tell my children I did not stay silent!!"" The  caption reads : ""DACA is an urgent issue and something we must address immediately. Each day in limbo in the life of these young Dreamers is a very long time. We cannot stay silent. We must pass the Dream Act now."" But Harris isn’t opposed to Christmas. We searched Google and the Nexis news database and found no statements from Harris saying she wants to ban Christmas or that she opposes the holiday.  PolitiFact  also   found   multiple   occasions   from   2017 to 2023  when Harris posted on her social media wishing people ""Merry Christmas.""

politifact,The 2024 election results show that Joe Biden’s 80 million votes in 2020 were a “lie.”,"President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party did not steal the 2020 election. Republican state and federal officials said the election was secure and dozens of judges have rejected lawsuits from Donald Trump and his supporters alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 election.      From election to election, it isn’t unusual or a sign of fraud for voters to shift support from one party to another or to choose not to vote, election experts said.      Votes in the 2024 election are still being counted. It is not yet clear how the total number of Vice President Kamala Harris’ votes will compare with Biden’s in 2020.","Conservatives are leveraging President-elect Donald Trump’s 2024 electoral victory to again allege the 2020 election was fraudulent. ""Kamala got 60 million votes in 2024,"" Dinesh D’Souza  wrote  around 8 a.m. ET Nov. 6 on X. ""Does anyone really believe Biden got 80 million in 2020? Where did those 20 million Democratic voters go? The truth is, they never existed. I think we can put the lie about Biden’s 80 million votes to rest once and for all."" D’Souza was behind the  widely discredited  2022 movie ""2,000 Mules"" that outlined an unsubstantiated effort by ""mules"" to illegally deposit ballots into ballot drop boxes to sway the 2020 election. We saw similar claims from conservative commentator Benny Johnson,  who called  the 2020 to 2024 Democratic vote count difference ""very sus,"" short for suspicious, and J.R. Majewski, an Ohio Republican who ran for Congress  unsuccessfully in 2022 and 2024 , who  declared  the results proved ""2020 was stolen.""  These claims are a revamped version of the  persistent falsehood   that the   2020 election   was   fraudulent , which PolitiFact has debunked countless times.  (Screenshot from X) We tried contacting D’Souza through his online store and Instagram account, and received no response before publication.  The 2020 election was not stolen. President Joe Biden  won the 2020 election . States certified the results, Congress accepted the results and Biden was inaugurated in January 2021. Election security officials — including  Republicans  and people in  Trump’s own administration  — have said the 2020 election was secure. When fraud occurred, it was isolated and did not change the results. In four years, Trump and his allies have produced no evidence of  widespread fraud . Across the country, Trump and his allies lost more than  60 lawsuits  challenging the 2020 election outcome. A group of Republicans, including former federal judges, examined Trump and his allies’ fraud and miscount claims and  concluded  that they ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results `significant enough to invalidate the results.""’ Trump’s 2024 victory has not changed these facts.  From election to election, millions of voters potentially shifting support from one party to another isn’t unusual, experts told PolitiFact.  Kim Wyman, a Bipartisan Policy Center  senior fellow , said about 40% of voters in the U.S. consider themselves independents and ""elections are won and lost with that 40%.""  ""Those middle voters vote all over the map and are the ones who decide the outcome,"" she said.  Wyman, a Republican, was Washington’s secretary of state from 2013 to 2021, when she stepped down to  take a position  as a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency senior election security adviser. She said the explanation for the 2024 results would be in election return data. ""Democrats did not suddenly lose 20 million voters,"" she said, outlining potential explanations for the 2024 outcome.  First, she said, it’s possible that 20 million Republicans or independent voters who either did not vote in the 2020 presidential election or voted for Biden in 2020 chose to vote for Trump in 2024.  Second, it’s possible that solid Democrats who did not want to vote for Trump or Harris did not vote in 2024 or possibly chose another candidate, such as Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Potentially, ""the 20 million is a combination"" of those two outcomes, Wyman said. Jordan Barth, a former national and state Democratic Party staff member, said that even if the final vote counts show that 20 million more people voted for Biden in 2020 than voted for Harris in 2024, that wouldn’t prove the 2020 election was fraudulent.  ""We saw some pretty significant changes in 2016 with the electorate,"" said Barth, who in 2020 was the hotline and research coordinator for the Democratic National Committee’s civic engagement and voter protection department. Places that had voted for Democratic President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 went for Trump in 2016. Then, in 2020, at least some of those voters ""went back to Biden.""  Wyman said election officials used the same processes and protocols during the 2020 and 2024 elections. ""While some states may have changed some laws, the security control measures remained consistent,"" she said. ""Just because voters show up and vote differently four years later doesn't mean there is fraud or suppression. It could just mean that voters changed their minds."" William Adler, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Election Project associate director, said the stolen 2020 election claims overlook a misleading and basic detail: The popular vote isn’t known yet. Although state margins, in terms of percentage points, might be close to the final results, current claims about actual numbers of voters hold little weight.  ""As counting continues, the difference between the number of votes Biden received and the number that Harris received is guaranteed to shrink,"" he said.  That is already playing out. By 2 p.m. ET Nov. 6, the Harris vote totals that Johnson, Majewski and D’Souza mentioned in their X posts were outdated: Harris had received more than  67 million votes  — and that was with incomplete counts in several states with high numbers of Democrats, including California, Oregon and Washington.  ""California is currently only 60% reported,"" Charles Stewart III, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Election Data and Science Lab, told PolitiFact at around 12:30 p.m. ET. States including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Washington ""still have at least 20% of their votes to report."" D’Souza claimed the results of the 2024 election show that Biden’s 80 million votes in 2020 were a ""lie."" Republican state and federal officials said the election was secure and dozens of judges have rejected Trump lawsuits alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 election.  From election to election, voters shifting support from one party to another — or forgoing voting — isn’t unusual or a sign of fraud, experts said. They also warned that votes are still being counted, and the margin of votes separating Harris’ 2024 total and Biden’s 2020 total is likely to shrink.

politifact,“I think they found a way to target Democratic districts and send millions of votes into a black hole. The numbers aren't adding up.”,"Millions of people voted early, setting records in some states, but that does not mean all or most of those people voted for Vice President Kamala Harris.     There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2024 election.      Ballots are still being counted, so it’s unclear how many votes each candidate received, and how those results compare with the 2020 election. ​","After major news outlets called a presidential election win for President-elect Donald Trump, some social media users cast doubt on the results. ""I'm thinking those votes were disappeared,"" a user  posted  Nov. 6 on Threads. ""I think they found a way to target Democratic districts and send millions of votes into a black hole. The numbers aren't adding up. How could there be record turnout on early votes and a huge drop off in the vote totals? It doesn't make sense."" The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) In 2020, President Joe Biden  won  the popular vote with more than 81 million votes. Trump got 74 million. Votes from the 2024 election were still being  counted  Nov. 7, but as of 4 p.m. EST, Trump had gotten more than 72 million votes to Vice President Kamala Harris’ 68 million. The difference in votes between the 2020 and 2024 elections is not evidence of fraud. Just as there was none in 2020, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2024 election. ""Our election infrastructure has never been more secure and the election community never better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people,"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a Nov. 6  statement . ""This is what we saw yesterday in the peaceful and secure exercise of democracy. Importantly, we have no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure."" Although the  media called  a winner based on existing counts and electoral gains, it’s still unclear precisely how many votes each candidate received and how those results compare with the 2020 election. ""Indeed, in some states, election officials can continue to accept vote-by-mail or absentee ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and are delivered over the next few days, so we don’t even yet know the total number of votes cast,"" Florida State University election law professor Michael Morley said. Every state has  different deadlines  for completing ballot counting, which range from one to four weeks after Election Day. After states finish their counts, they then must certify the results. Those deadlines fall  in November and December . Just as the final vote tally for each candidate is currently unknown, so is the 2024 election’s voter turnout. ""We won’t have a complete picture of voter turnout comparisons across elections until each state provides certified voter turnout files,"" said Carolina Lopez, executive director of the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions, a nonpartisan organization that works with election officials in jurisdictions of 300,000 people or more. It’s also memorable that the 2020 election had record high voter turnout. According to the  U.S. Census Bureau , 67% of citizens 18 or older reported voting. A Washington Post  analysis  showed voter turnout in 2024 is on pace to be close to 2020.  In the weeks before Election Day,  local   news   organizations  reported record-setting early voter turnout in different states. By Nov. 4, the day before Election Day, more than 78 million ballots had been cast in 42 states and Washington, D.C., according to a CNN  analysis . In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 110 million people voted early in person or by mail, according to CNN.  But high early voter counts don’t signal a fraudulent Trump win. Not all the millions of early voters cast ballots for Harris. It’s also difficult to draw conclusions about voter behavior during the 2024 election by comparing it with the 2020 election, when  Trump discouraged  early and mail voting.  ""Republican messaging concerning vote by mail and absentee ballots has changed this election cycle,"" Morley said, adding that Republicans encouraged early and mail voting. ""Accordingly, we would expect the partisan breakdown of voters who use those methods of voting to have changed between the 2020 and 2024 elections."" A social media user said: ""I think they found a way to target Democratic districts and send millions of votes into a black hole. The numbers aren't adding up."" However, just as there was no widespread voter fraud in 2020, there is no evidence of it in the 2024 election.  Ballots are still being counted, so it’s unclear how many votes each candidate received, and how those results compare with the 2020 election.  Millions of people voted early, setting records in some states. But those early voters could have supported Trump, Harris, a third party candidate or chosen not to vote in the presidential election at all.

politifact,“CCTV captures the moment a Trump voter in (Wisconsin) is assaulted by two Kamala Harris thugs at a voting station.”,"The Wisconsin Elections Commission said it received no reports of an assault at any polling place.     Darren Linvill, a Clemson University disinformation researcher, said a video purportedly showing a Trump voter being assaulted has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign by Storm-1516.     X suspended at least two accounts that shared the video.","A video circulating on X purported to show a Donald Trump voter being attacked by two Kamala Harris supporters at a Wisconsin polling station.  That didn’t happen, a Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson said, and a social media disinformation expert said the video is Russian disinformation. ""BREAKING: CCTV captures the moment a Trump voter in WI is assaulted by two Kamala Harris thugs at a voting station in Wisconsin,"" said a lengthy  Nov. 5 X post  by an Australian political commentator that used the abbreviation for closed-circuit television. The post shared a soundless video of what looks like a polling station with three people casting their ballots. In the video, a man wearing a red hat — presumably with now-President-elect Donald Trump’s ""Make America Great Again"" slogan — approaches with a ballot and a man voting wearing a white Harris hoodie confronts him and pushes him out of camera range. Then another person in a red hoodie assaults the Trump voter, who’s seen falling to the floor. But that didn’t happen at a Wisconsin polling station, Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson Joel DeSpain wrote in an email to PolitiFact. ""We received no reports from law enforcement and no reports from any Wisconsin polling locations that this incident took place in the Badger State,"" DeSpain said. NewsGuard, a company that tracks online false narratives,  noted  that  Wisconsin does not allow  people to wear politically themed attire, such as Trump hats or Harris hoodies, inside polling stations. (Screenshot from X) Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Watt Family Innovation Center Media Forensics Hub, said in a  Nov. 5 X post  that the video is disinformation created by Storm-1516, a Russian influence operation.  Storm-1516 was behind two recent Pants on Fire! fake videos that pretended to show Haitian immigrants in the U.S. illegally  saying they are voting for Vice President Kamala Harris  in Georgia, and a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, election official  destroying mail ballots . This video is Russian, Storm-1516 disinformation. No one was attacked at a polling station in Wisconsin. The video is created in a manner consistent with past Storm narratives and  @AlertChannel  is an account Terada's R-FBI has used consistently for distribution.  pic.twitter.com/FrtuJRCtRe Linvill said he and his Clemson colleagues have tracked Storm-1516 for the past year and ""are very familiar with its tactics, techniques and procedures."" The Media Forensics Hub first identified the Russian network in December 2023, it said in an  October report .  Linvill told PolitiFact that there are several reasons they attributed the Wisconsin video to Storm-1516, including the video’s attempt to incite violence and the group’s previous videos targeting battleground states Pennsylvania and Georgia. ""The origin account (Scott Goldberg, using the X handle @izzagg) is an account that only recently started posting,"" Linvill said, adding that it’s consistent with how Storm-1516 has created videos in the past — by creating an account and making videos that ""look just plausible enough to be convincing if you don’t look too hard.""   Another Storm-1516 hallmark is that the video, which is shot from above, shows no faces or anything that could possibly identify anyone, Linvill said.  Linvill said Storm-1516 used an account named @AlertChannel, which is part of its regular distribution network, to boost the video. The group also used Jamie McIntyre, ""an Australian influencer who joined the distribution network a couple of months ago,"" Linvill said. We found another Australian account  sharing the video  on X. As of Nov. 7, X had suspended the  @AlertChannel  and  Scott Golberg (@izzaag)  accounts that originally shared it. X suspended three accounts that shared Russian disinformation about the election, including the Wisconsin video,  CBS News reported . We contacted X via email for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Linvill said it’s likely that McIntyre’s account wasn’t suspended because he is a public figure and a real person, he said. Linvill said the Goldberg account was a fake persona and @Alertchannel was anonymous, and therefore easier to suspend. An X post claimed to show a video of a Trump supporter being assaulted by two Harris supporters at a Wisconsin polling station. But a Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson said it received no reports of an assault happening at a polling station.

(Screenshot from Threads) These claims are inaccurate. There have been no credible allegations of election fraud or evidence of votes that disappeared during the 2024 election. On Nov. 6, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said that election officials are still counting votes and reported no incidents of compromised election security. ""As we have said repeatedly, our election infrastructure has never been more secure and the election community never better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people,""  Easterly said . ""This is what we saw yesterday in the peaceful and secure exercise of democracy. Importantly, we have no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure."" Similarly, Ishan Mehta, director of media and democracy at Common Cause,   a public advocacy group, said the 2024 election was safe, secure and ""pretty smooth."" He said Common Cause has thousands of volunteers in all 50 states who monitored the election at polling sites and vote counting centers. The group also has a team that monitors chatter about voting on social media. Because of that, Common Cause typically knows when election issues arise — and those incidents typically end up being ""some sort of machine or human error that we have systems to correct,"" Mehta said. Such incidents do not mean ""the election was hacked, or there has been any sort of nefarious activity to change any Americans’ actual votes,"" he said. ""There is no evidence that any votes disappeared,"" or of other fraudulent activity during the 2024 election, Mehta said. He also said he knew of no evidence of attempts — let alone successful efforts — to ""hack"" or ""steal"" the election.  Even if such attempts occurred, they would fail, experts said.  ""There is no one ‘hack’ to change the outcome of an election or to change vote totals,"" Mehta said. ""Each state has its own independent, non-connected systems,"" and election workers are trained to run elections and fix any issues that arise and take that responsibility seriously. Experts repeatedly told PolitiFact that voter turnout ebbs and flows from election to election. Paul Gronke, a Reed College political science professor, said factors such as enthusiasm for the candidates, campaign efforts and an election’s competitiveness all affect voter turnout.  ""If the final results show that 20 million fewer votes were cast for the Democratic candidate for President in 2024 than in 2020, what that indicates is that 20 million voters made a decision not to cast a ballot, either not turn out at all, or not check the top contest,"" Gronke said. ""That’s the end of the story."" Election denial is antidemocratic,  said  David Becker, the executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that works with election officials from both political parties to build trust in elections.  ""We will know the full turnout once the votes are certified by the states, in a few weeks,"" he told PolitiFact. Becker pointed to  data  from the University of Florida: ""We’re on track to have the second highest turnout in votes in U.S. history, and the second or third highest turnout in percentage since 18 year olds were granted the right to vote,"" he said. Election denial is anti-democratic, whether it comes from the left or the right. No, 20 million votes aren’t missing. Votes are still being counted in many states, incl millions in CA alone.

""Election officials, election monitors, election lawyers, partisan observers, non partisan observers, and election science experts like myself pay very close attention to elections at every level,"" Gronke said. ""There have been reports of a few glitches in scattered locations. There is no evidence at all of anything fraudulent, certainly not on the kind of scale being suggested here.""

politifact,President-elect Donald Trump “has been to Epstein’s island”,"President-elect Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein attended the same parties in the 1990s, and Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet at least seven times.      The two had a falling out years ago, Trump said, and there’s no evidence Trump visited Epstein’s private island where prosecutors said Epstein sex trafficked underage girls.","After 2024 election results showed President-elect Donald Trump won, an Instagram post claimed Trump had visited the private island owned by the late financier and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  The  Instagram post  showed a world map with the U.S. highlighted in red, claiming to show ""countries that just elected a president who has been to Epstein’s island.""  Trump and Epstein operated in the same social circles in the 1990s, and Trump occasionally spoke highly of him. But there has been no documented evidence that Trump visited Epstein’s private island, Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, where Epstein allegedly sexually abused underage girls.  When federal agents charged Epstein with sex trafficking of minors in 2019, Trump, then president,  said he was  ""not a fan"" of Epstein.  Trump has said he did not visit Epstein’s private island. Flight logs show that Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane  at least seven times  in the 1990s between Palm Beach and New York, but there’s no evidence Trump visited the island. Many other high-profile people, including former President Bill Clinton, were also recorded as guests on Epstein’s plane.  Epstein  died by suicide  in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. A  federal indictment  alleged Epstein had, for years, enticed and recruited underage girls to perform sex acts, and encouraged victims to recruit additional victims. The acts occurred both at his home in Manhattan and in Palm Beach, Florida, the indictment alleged. Abuse and sex trafficking also allegedly occurred at Little St. James,  according to a lawsuit  from the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general.  He was convicted on  Florida state charges  in 2008 for paying a minor for sex, after which he served jail time and registered as a sex offender. Acquaintances of both Trump and Epstein said the two were friends in the 1990s, according to a 2019  Washington Post  story. Epstein attended parties at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, and the two were photographed together in social settings multiple times. In an interview for a 2002  New York magazine  piece, Trump called Trump a ""terrific guy.""  ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,"" Trump said. After Epstein’s arrest in 2019,  Trump said  he ""had a falling out"" with Epstein, and said he had not spoken to him in 15 years.  ""I was not a fan of his, I can tell you that,"" Trump told reporters at the time. In a September  interview with podcaster Lex Fridman , Trump said he never visited Epstein’s private island.  ""I never went to his island, fortunately,"" Trump said. ""But a lot of people did."" Sometime around the time Epstein first faced charges for sex crimes with minors, Trump banned him from Mar-a-Lago, the Washington Post reported. In the 2016 book, ""The Clintons’ War on Women,"" Trump ally and political consultant Roger Stone — whom Trump pardoned after he was convicted for obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering — wrote that Trump had turned down multiple invitations to ""Epstein’s hedonistic private island and his Palm Beach home."" Stone wrote that Trump ""cut Epstein and his underlings off"" when he heard Palm Beach police were investigating Epstein.  Stone wrote that Trump told a Mar-a-Lago club member, ""‘The one time I visited his Palm Beach home, the swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls’ … ‘How nice,’ I thought, ‘he let the neighborhood kids use his pool.’"" Shortly before the Nov. 5 election, journalist and author Michael Wolff  released excerpts  from a 2017 interview with Epstein, in which Epstein claimed he was ""Donald Trump’s closest friend for 10 years."" However, the new audio included no statements from Epstein saying Trump had visited his island. The Trump campaign called Wolff a ""disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies"" in response to the recording, according to The Daily Beast. In October, former model Stacey Williams  alleged Trump groped her  in 1993 after Epstein introduced her to him. The Trump campaign denied Williams’ story. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request from PolitiFact to comment on the Instagram post’s claim.

politifact,“Something stinks” that Donald Trump won in several battleground states while Democrats won Senate or governor races in those states.,"There’s a strong correlation between votes cast for president and senator, but it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates of different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters do.      In each of the races cited, the Democrats benefited from an advantage or two, such as incumbency or a politically damaged opponent.     In the four Senate races cited in this social media graphic, the margins were narrow, meaning that the dynamics of third-party voters or voters who chose to vote for president and not for Senate race could have easily made a difference.","Some social media users expressed incredulity when they learned that Democrats have won or are leading in U.S. Senate or governor races in states in which Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump. One Nov. 7  Instagram post  shared a screengrab of an  X post  that contained a graphic showing the partisan breakdown of wins in a number of swing states.  Trump, the graphic showed, had won or was winning the battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada,  North Carolina and Wisconsin, but Democratic Senate candidates (or in North Carolina, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate) had won or were winning their contests in those states. ""What are the odds of this happening in 5 of the swing states?"" words in the screengrab said. ""Honest question. And not all Senate incumbents either.""  ""Something stinks,"" the Instagram user wrote in response. ""This doesn’t make any sense."" (Screengrab from Instagram)  The post has accurately described the results as they sat by midday Nov. 8, three days postelection. Although these results may not make sense at first glance, they happened for several reasons. Voters have free will . Presidential and Senate votes tend to align; in most 2024 Senate races, the same party did win both contests in the same state. But there’s a long-standing phenomenon known as ticket-splitting, in which voters may choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another.  Ticket splitting has become less common in recent election cycles as partisan polarization has increased. In 2016, every Senate race went to the same party as the presidential race did, and in 2020, only Maine voters split their ticket in voting for Republican Sen. Susan Collins and for Joe Biden for president. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely. In gubernatorial races, states such as Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia have chosen a governor of a different party than the presidential choice in the most recent election. And, in the current Congress, more than  two   dozen  U.S. House members represent districts that the other party won in 2020. Candidates matter . Voters split tickets because elections are a choice between candidates, not just between parties. Incumbency can help candidates; so can a lack of controversy, or a bigger war chest for campaign ads or a better-run campaign. Two of the Senate races on the list cited in the post had incumbents prevail (or had them on track to prevail, pending additional ballot counting): Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen of Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity may have helped these candidates. Some voters may have wanted to send a message on inflation in the presidential race but decided that the Senate has less to do with economic conditions than the president does. Meanwhile, in North Carolina’s gubernatorial race, Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein faced Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a Republican candidate who faced a  flurry of revelations  about his past controversial comments on race and sex. Robinson won about 40% of the vote in a state in which generic Republican candidates for statewide office can usually count on 50% or better. And in Arizona, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a retired U.S. Marine and a Latino in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate. Don’t sleep on third parties and nonvotes . In the four Senate-race split decisions, the margins were narrow. In these four states, the Democratic Senate candidates won (or are winning) by 17,000 to 44,000 votes; in Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris lost (or is losing) by between 29,000 and 82,000 votes. Arizona was wider at 155,000. With such small margins, other factors can figure in election results if you run the math.  In these states’ Senate races, third-party candidates received from 39,000 to 170,000 votes; in the presidential race, their haul ranged from 25,000 to 110,000. Also, some people voted for president but not for a Senate candidate, and may have skipped other down-ballot races. Depending on the state, from 18,000 to 72,000 voters did this, according to PolitiFact’s calculations from  The New York Times’  running election results page. If these Senate race-skippers consisted disproportionately of Trump voters, that by itself could have kept some of these Republican Senate candidates from winning. Then there’s Nevada’s eccentric ballot option,""none of these candidates."" In the presidential race, about 18,000 voters chose this option; in the Senate race, more than 40,000 did. The number of ""none of these candidates"" voters in the Senate race is more than twice as large as Rosen’s current lead. A nontrivial share of voters chose to back a third-party candidate or decline to choose anyone in the U.S. Senate race. In some or all of these states, that could have spelled the difference between victory and defeat.  Social media posts said ""something stinks"" that Trump won in several battleground states while Democrats won Senate or governor races in those states. Although there’s a strong historical correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates of different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters does so. In each of these races, the Democrats benefited from an advantage or two, such as incumbency or a politically damaged opponent, that may have put them over the top.

Ballots marked as needing signature verification weren’t being thrown out, and there’s still time to fix any ballot problems, the secretary of state’s office said. Nevada law allows voters to ""cure"" or resolve any problems with a signature on a mail ballot return envelope, such as a missing or mismatched signature. Nevadans have until 5 p.m. PST on Nov. 12 to cure their ballots, the secretary of state’s  website  said. We didn’t find that this curing process was a Republican-led effort. Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar is a Democrat. In 2021, Democratic lawmakers in Nevada  passed a law  to send every active voter in the state a mail-in ballot for all future elections starting in 2022. (Nevadans can still opt-out and vote in person early or on Election Day.) This law also instructed election officials on how to verify ballot signatures and established a curing process for voters. As of Nov. 8, the secretary of state’s  website  said 13,030 mail ballots, or 1.9% of all returned ballots in Nevada, needed signature cures. Of these mail ballots, 11,039 belong to voters in Clark County, the state’s most populous county. Washoe County had the next highest number, with 1,206 mail ballots needing signature cures. Nevada election officials are contacting the voters by mail, phone and email who needed to cure their ballots. Voters can also check the secretary of state’s website themselves to see whether their ballot needs to be fixed. Once these ballots are cured, they can be counted. Any ballots that aren’t cured will not be counted. Clark County Registrar of Voters Lorena Portillo said during a Nov. 6  press briefing  that the mail ballot signature cure process is ""very quick."" ""Once we get that phone call, the voter provides pertinent personal information that we can use to verify their identity, and then we can proceed. It doesn’t take long,"" Portillo said. Secretary of State Aguilar expressed concerns on the morning of Election Day about young voters not having their mail ballot signatures match their driver’s license signatures. He  told The New York Times  that ""young people don’t have signatures these days."" Later in the day on Nov. 5, Aguilar said in a  statement  that ""the need for signature cure goes beyond youth."" He said that older voters may sign their names differently throughout their lives and recently married voters may not have updated their name on their voter registration. ""Since the passage of Automatic Voter Registration, more Nevadans than ever sign their names on digital screens that may look different than their pen-to-paper signatures,"" Aguilar said. In the  2022 general election , 5,979 ballots needing signature verification were not counted because they weren’t cured. In the  2020 general election , 2,887 ballots weren’t counted because of signature problems, according to data from the secretary of state. A Threads post warned, ""In Nevada, the GOP is succeeding in throwing out the votes of thousands of young people."" Some Nevadans’ votes will not be counted if their ballots are not ""cured"" by the deadline, but this is not because the state or the Republican Party are ""throwing out"" their votes.

And broadly speaking, voting machines are not connected to the internet, experts said.      A Starlink satellite reentered Earth’s atmosphere Nov. 10 and exploded. Experts said such reentries have been happening almost daily for the past few years and are not noteworthy.","Some social media users claim to have found an explanation for Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 election loss. They say billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes to benefit President-elect Donald Trump. Starlink is an internet provider that uses satellites to provide connectivity; it’s a subsidiary of Musk’s commercial spaceflight company SpaceX. ""Musk’s Starlink uploaded votes in swing states,"" one  Nov. 10 Threads post said . ""Swing state voters went Dem downballot but Trump at the top? Unlikely. Starlink satellites exploding, destroying evidence."" Starlink made headlines in recent weeks  when the company   distributed equipment  to help people regain internet access in hurricane-hit areas.

The Russians are known hackers,"" said another  Nov. 10 Threads post . ""Elon Musk and the US gov. sent Starlink terminals to Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia due to the hurricanes.""

(Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Election security experts and state and local election officials rebutted the claims, saying the 2024 presidential election was secure and there’s no evidence of Starlink-related fraud. ""Starlink is suspected by conspiracy theorists not because of what it does, but because Elon Musk owns it,"" Mike Rothschild, a journalist, author and conspiracy theory  expert , said. This conspiracy theory circulated on Threads amid  a larger wave  of election denial claims from liberals that mimic Republicans’ false claims about 2020 election fraud. ""Conspiracy theories about lost elections being stolen are a natural way to cope with an unexpected outcome,"" Rothschild said, adding that it’s important to ""leave conspiracism behind and embrace reality."" Jen Easterly, director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,  reported  Nov. 6 that the agency had ""no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure."" Officials from swing states that received Starlink technology after the September and October hurricanes also said Starlink technology could not have been used to benefit Trump. North Carolina’s tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet, Patrick Gannon, the North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson, said. State law  prohibits  connecting such equipment to the internet, he said. ""Satellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,"" Gannon said. ""In addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. We have no evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone."" The other six swing states —  Arizona ,  Georgia ,  Michigan ,  Nevada ,  Pennsylvania  and  Wisconsin  — have similar election security protocols to ensure voting equipment is never connected to the internet during ballot tabulation. Even if Starlink had somehow been used to modify the vote count, there are systems designed to catch tabulation discrepancies, including risk-limiting audits, canvassing and certification of the election results, said Michael Specter, a Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor specializing in election security. ""None of these are foolproof, but each makes it significantly less likely that an attack would be successful,"" Specter said. Broadly speaking, voting machines are not connected to the internet, experts said. In some states, ballot tabulators are briefly connected to the internet to transmit results when polls close. And in many places, other election infrastructure, such as pollbooks with lists of digital voter registration records, have internet connectivity. We found little evidence Starlink is widely used during elections. Even in Asheville, North Carolina’s Buncombe County, one of the places hardest hit by Hurricane Helene, election officials told PolitiFact that Starlink was not used for any election functions. Genya Coulter, senior election analyst for the OSET Institute, a nonprofit group focused on accurate, secure and transparent elections, said she knew Starlink technology had been used to support election infrastructure in one place:  Tulare County, California . Trump  won  Tulare County with about 60% of the vote. ""Most of the rural part of the county has little to no access to broadband, and Starlink was used to have the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database,"" Coulter said. Pollbooks are lists of digital voter registration records. Vote tabulators weren’t connected to Starlink satellite internet, she said, adding that the county had about 28,000 in-person voters. Regarding claims about Russian hackers swaying election outcomes, Coulter said she was ""less worried about Russian hackers affecting vote totals and significantly more concerned"" with the deluge of incorrect election information that  Russian-linked groups distributed  online before the election and the bomb threats targeting election infrastructure  that officials  said were ""of Russian origin."" On Nov. 10, a Starlink satellite reentered Earth’s atmosphere heading southeast from Washington to Texas and exploded. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and science data system group leader at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Center, said there’s nothing noteworthy about that. ""This is not a case of suddenly deciding to retire this satellite within the past week,"" McDowell said. ""Such reentries have been happening almost daily for the past few years, they just are at random times and random places in the world so not often over the U.S. at night where Americans can see it."" According to U.S. Space Force data, SpaceX removed this particular satellite from operation Aug. 2, at which point the satellite started lowering its orbit, McDowell said. SpaceX abandoned the satellite Oct. 13, McDowell said. Stargazers in the southwest United States  reported  seeing fireballs in the early morning hours Nov. 10. McDowell said that’s normal: During satellite reentry and breakup, observers can sometimes see fireballs moving slowly across the sky. Some of the posts that floated the Starlink conspiracy theory pointed to Democratic successes in some down-ballot races as evidence that something was off in the Trump-Harris results. Although there’s a strong correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad.  Voters are free to choose candidates from different parties  for different offices, and some fraction of voters do. Ticket-splitting — when voters choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another — has become less common in recent election cycles as political polarization has increased. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely. Incumbency can help candidates win reelection. For instance, two swing states had Democratic incumbents keep their Senate seats: Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity might have helped these candidates. Controversy, or a lack thereof, can also affect candidates’ campaigns. In Arizona, for example, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the 2020 presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a retired U.S. Marine and a Latino, in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate. Specter said split-ticket voting ""does not provide sufficient evidence that any malfeasance has occurred."" Threads posts said Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes in the 2024 election to benefit Trump.

politifact,“Paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down.”,Studies have shown voting machines produce more accurate counts compared with hand counts.     Voting machines are tested for accuracy and are audited after they are used in elections.      Most U.S. voters live in jurisdictions in which hand-marking paper ballots is the norm.,"Questions about voting machines’ accuracy are common during election season, and the 2024 election reignited calls for ballots to be counted by hand.  One  post  from the Diamond and Silk Instagram account claimed our elections would be better off if only paper ballots were cast and if they were counted by hand. ""Paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down,"" the post said.  The post also questioned the use of voting machines, saying, ""they always break down on Election Day.""  Diamond and Silk — sisters Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson — became well known for their pro-Donald Trump social media commentary before Hardaway, known as Diamond, died in January 2023.  The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Studies have consistently shown that ballot tabulating machines — the machines that receive paper ballots and electronically count the votes — are  more accurate  than hand-counting in large numbers. The machines are tested for accuracy before the election, and results are audited in nearly every state.  What’s more, most voters in the U.S. already use  hand-marked paper ballots  to cast their votes.  The Diamond and Silk account didn’t respond to requests for comment. Hand-counting paper ballots is tedious, time-consuming and prone to human error.  A 2004  Massachusetts Institute of Technology study  examined the variance in vote totals in New Hampshire recounts between hand-counting and machine tabulating. The study found that machine tabulation had a significantly lower variance between the initial count and the recount than hand-counting, meaning the machines were more accurate.  A 2007  Rice University study  tested the accuracy of hand-counting 120 ballots in two races with predetermined results. The participants accurately counted the two races 58% of the time.  Hand-counting ballots is also expensive and time-constraining for local election officials, especially when ballots can include dozens of races.  A  2023 study  by Arizona’s Mohave County Elections Department found that hand-counting the 2024 general election results would require 245 people working 19 eight-hour days, which would cost about $521,000. Accounting for other expenses such as security guards, cameras and additional staff, the study estimated hand-counts for both the 2024 primary and general elections would cost the county $1.1 million.  When accounting for human error, it’s wrong to say that hand-counting ""never breaks down,"" as it’s shown to be less reliable than machine counting. Voting systems  are tested stringently  before  they’re used in elections. Election officials use test ballots to ensure machine counts are accurate and to identify errors.  It’s an exaggeration to say voting machines ""always break down"" on Election Day, even if some counties run into errors. Each of the more than 3,000 counties in the U.S. has its own set of laws and voting systems to conduct elections, meaning errors sometimes  happen .  But voting in the 2024 election went  relatively smoothly , and most counties used ballot tabulating machines problem-free. The machine-counted results are also often verified after the election through audits. Every state but Alabama conducts some type of postelection audit, according to the  National Conference of State Legislatures . Most often, this involves hand-counting a small percentage of the ballots to compare them with the machine-tabulated results.  The post also ignores that paper ballots are  widely used  in U.S. elections; most U.S. voters already mark candidate preferences using paper ballots, which machine tabulators then count. Verified Voting , a nonpartisan organization focused on election technology, said close to 70% of U.S. voters live in jurisdictions in which hand-marked paper ballots are the norm. An extra 25% use electronic ballot marking devices, in which voters mark their choices on a machine that prints a paper ballot. And 5% use direct recording electronic systems, which record selections directly into computer memory. A Diamond and Silk Instagram post said ""paper ballots and hand counting never breaks down.""  Hand-counting is prone to human error, as ballot counters can misread choices or accidentally record the wrong result. Ballot tabulating machines are tested for high accuracy and have a far lower error rate than hand-counting.  Although there were isolated incidents of machine malfunctions during the 2024 election, the vast majority of voting systems worked as intended.  We rate the claim False.

Lake’s campaign also shared the letter in a Nov. 8  X post , which had nearly 500,000 views by Nov. 12.

Homan, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, is listed as one of dozens of Project 2025  contributors . A  CBS News analysis  of Project 2025 found more than 700 specific policy proposals.

You can’t cheat with voter ID."" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Let’s cut to the chase: Trump alone won in states that have strict voter ID requirements, as defined by the National Conference of State Legislatures, but he also won in states with looser laws. And claims that Harris exclusively won states without voter ID requirements flatten the nuances of the voter ID debate, ignoring state and federal laws to verify voters’ identity before they can vote in person or mail a ballot. Voter ID laws across the country Voter ID laws across the country are not one-size-fits-all.  According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 36 states  request or require voters  to show some form of ID at the polls. The remaining 14 states and Washington, D.C., require no form of identification to vote at the polls but  use other methods to verify voters’ identities , such as matching voters’ signatures or asking voters for personal information. And federal law  requires first-time voters to show ID  when requesting mail ballots, while some states have additional ID requirements for voters mailing in ballots. As we’ve  reported , among the 36 states that do request or require some form of identification to vote in person, the laws vary widely as to whether they are strictly applied or whether a photo ID or another form of identification is accepted. As for mail ballots, states have different laws and procedures for verifying the identity of voters who don’t vote in person. In 22 states, voters applying for a mail ballot must show ID, provide an ID number, such as from a driver’s license, or obtain a witness or notary signature, according to the  Voting Rights Lab , an organization tracking state election laws and proposed legislation. In 21 other states, voters requesting mail ballots must verify their identity using personal information, such as date of birth. The remaining seven states and Washington, D.C., have universal mail voting, so ballots are automatically sent to voters ahead of every election, without voters needing to request them. Election officials in every state  use signature verification  to validate the identities of voters who cast mail ballots, the National Vote at Home Institute said. Comparing states Harris, Trump won and voter ID laws Next, let’s compare  the states Harris and Trump won  with their voter identification laws.  Harris won: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, , New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island,  Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. and Washington state. Some of the states Harris won don’t require documents to vote. Oregon, for example,  mails a ballot  to registered voters before Election Day, but it verifies voters’ identities when they register using  an acceptable form of identification  including a driver’s license, valid photo ID or Social Security number.  But other states Harris won do ask for identification: Washington, Colorado, Connecticut. Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. In Washington state, identification is requested but the state holds all elections by mail, ""so this provision impacts few voters,"" the National Conference of State Legislatures said. Colorado similarly holds elections by mail and requests ID, so its law affects in-person Election Day voters. Photo ID is requested in Rhode Island, according to the group, and if voters don’t have one, they must vote on a provisional ballot and then election officials match their signatures against the signatures on record.  Photo ID isn’t required in Connecticut, but identification is requested. If it’s not presented, voters must give their name, date of birth and address and sign under penalty of making a false statement. In New Hampshire, a voter without identification must sign a challenged voter affidavit. After the election, a mailing is sent and the voter must sign and return it or risk a voter fraud investigation.  The National Conference of State Legislatures slots states into five categories in its analysis of voter ID laws across the country: strict photo ID, strict non-photo ID, photo ID requested, ID requested; photo not required, and no document required to vote.  Trump alone won states with strict voter ID laws, but he also won states in which photo ID and non-photo ID are requested, and two states in which no documents are required. Strict photo ID Arkansas (Trump) Georgia (Trump) Indiana (Trump) Kansas (Trump) Mississippi (Trump) North Carolina (Trump) Ohio (Trump) Tennessee (Trump) Wisconsin (Trump) Strict non-photo ID Arizona (Trump) North Dakota (Trump) Wyoming (Trump) Photo ID requested Alabama (Trump) Florida (Trump) Idaho (Trump) Louisiana (Trump) Michigan (Trump) Missouri (Trump) Montana (Trump) Nebraska (Trump) Rhode Island (Harris) South Carolina (Trump) South Dakota (Trump) Texas (Trump) ID requested; photo not required Alaska (Trump) Colorado (Harris) Connecticut (Harris) Delaware (Harris) Iowa (Trump) Kentucky (Trump) New Hampshire (Harris) Oklahoma (Trump) Virginia (Harris) Utah (Trump) Washington (Harris) West Virginia (Trump) No document required to vote in person California (Harris) Hawaii (Harris) Illinois (Harris) Nevada (Trump) New Mexico (Harris) Maine (Harris) Maryland (Harris) Massachusetts (Harris) Minnesota (Harris) New Jersey (Harris) New York (Harris) Oregon (Harris) Pennsylvania (Trump) Vermont (Harris) Although efforts to tighten identification requirements for voting have been underway for about two decades, they accelerated after the 2020 election, when Republican lawmakers sympathetic to Trump’s false claims of voter fraud  pushed for tighter voter ID requirements  to combat fraud. So, it’s unsurprising that states that have stricter laws voted for the Republican presidential candidate.  National experts, meanwhile, have said such fraud is  isolated and rare.  Democrats and voting rights advocates have criticized some state voter ID laws, particularly ones with narrow lists of acceptable types of ID, as overly burdensome.  Our ruling The Instagram post said, ""Every state that does not require voter ID, Kamala won."" It’s not true that only Trump won states with voter ID laws while Harris won every state without.  Trump won the nine states that the National Conference of State Legislatures says have strict photo ID laws, and he won the three states the group says have strict non-photo ID laws. He also won 11 of the states in which photo ID is requested; Harris won one such state.  Trump and Harris each won six states in which some form of identification is requested. And Trump won two of the states the conference classifies as not requiring documents to vote; Harris won 12 such states.  But these classifications are shorthand for a variety of voter ID requirements and verifications process across the country, including verifying voters’ identities when they register to vote in states in which they automatically receive a mail ballot. Social media posts lumping Harris with states that purportedly don’t require identification and Trump with those that do lose that nuance.

politifact,"“Every single county in America, every single county, Kamala Harris did worse than Joe Biden did.”","An analysis of Wisconsin county election results in the 2020 and 2024 presidential races shows Vice President Kamala Harris got a greater share of the vote than President Joe Biden in six counties.      Harris also matched Biden’s share of the vote in two counties.      Although that’s only eight out of the state’s 72 counties, it proves wrong Vos’ statement that Harris did worse than Biden in ""every single county in America.""","Republicans nationwide woke up feeling good last week as former President Donald Trump recaptured the White House, defeating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. (And for the third presidential contest in a row,  Wisconsin played a crucial role. )  As analysts unpack these results in the coming days and weeks, expect to see them mull over why President Joe Biden  was able to beat Trump in 2020 , but Harris couldn’t match his numbers.  In Wisconsin, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester — who  easily won reelection himself  — suggested during a Nov. 6  news conference that it’s because Democrats nationally have taken key voting blocs for granted, and many of those voters this time chose Trump.  Exit polls and numbers show he may be right on that, but then he went too far, claiming, based on what he’d seen on television, that ""every single county in America, every single county, Kamala Harris did worse than Joe Biden did.""  That might have been accurate at some point as results trickled in on election night, but it sure didn’t stay that way.  Let’s break it down.  Vos’ office didn’t respond to a request for the evidence he used to make his claim.  It might have been a little tedious to identify where Harris outperformed or matched Biden across all of America’s 3,000-plus counties. For time’s sake, we’ll look just at Wisconsin.  There were six counties across the Badger State where Harris’ share of the vote this year was greater than Biden’s share of the vote in 2020, and two more in which their share of the vote was the same. Those include:  Brown County, where both  Harris  and  Biden  received 45.5% of the vote  Door County, where  Harris received 50.6% of the vote  to  Biden’s 49.9%   Eau Claire County, where  Harris received 54.5% of the vote  to  Biden’s 54.3% Manitowoc County, where  Harris received 37.6% of the vote  to  Biden’s 37.5% Ozaukee County, where  Harris received 43.9% of the vote  to  Biden’s 43.2%   Taylor County, where both  Harris  and  Biden  received 25.2% of the vote Washington County, where  Harris received 31.2% of the vote  to  Biden’s 30.2% Waukesha County, where  Harris received 39.3% of the vote  to  Biden’s 38.8%   There were some counties where Harris received more raw votes than Biden did in 2020, but a lower share of the vote total. That may have happened because of votes for third-party candidates, or because the county population grew in the last four years — such as in Dane County, in which Harris received almost 14,000 more votes than Biden, but captured 75.1% of the vote to Biden’s 75.7%. As such, we’ll keep this analysis to counties where Harris’ vote share outperformed or matched Biden’s.  And while she only did so in eight out of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, that proves wrong Vos’ assertion that she did worse than Biden in ""every single county in America.""  There are also other examples across the country — according to a  Nov. 6 New York Times analysis , nationally, about 10% of counties had shifted more Democratic since 2020. (Some Western states were still counting votes then, too.)  Vos claimed that ""every single county in America, every single county, Kamala Harris did worse than Joe Biden did.""  An analysis of the 2020 and 2024 election results in Wisconsin alone shows he’s wrong — Harris received a greater share of the vote than Biden did in six of 72 counties, and matched his share of the vote in two others.  We rate this claim False. ",false,Robin Vos,2024-11-06,2024-11-14,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/kamala_harris_speaks_in_wisconsin_july_23_24/b3c1f127f92a231429b97325f4069187.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/14/robin-vos/vos-wrong-that-harris-did-worse-than-biden-in-ever/,"National, Elections, States, Wisconsin, Robin Vos"

politifact,A “ballot dump” around 4 a.m. in Milwaukee shows the Wisconsin Senate election was stolen from the Republican candidate.,"Wisconsin law does bars election officials from processing absentee ballots early, making it routine for an influx of absentee ballot votes to be reported late at night or in the early morning hours after Election Day.      Separately, because of an error during the initial absentee ballot tabulation, the Milwaukee Election Commission said it would retabulate more than 30,000 ballots, which further delayed the city’s results.     A former Milwaukee Election Commission executive director told PolitiFact that Milwaukee Central Count’s tabulators don’t report partial results. That means its vote totals are ""delivered in one fell swoop,"" typically between midnight and 4 a.m., she said.","Multiple news organizations called a Wisconsin U.S. Senate race for the Democratic candidate  Nov. 6 .  Six days later, the Republican candidate  acknowledged  his loss but did not concede and instead cast doubt on the legitimacy of the results.  By the time Republican challenger Eric Hovde spoke out following days of silence, social media posters had already fueled claims that a 4 a.m. influx of Wisconsin votes proved that Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin stole the election from Hovde.  ""Once again, a 3:30am ballot dump lost us a critical race in Wisconsin,"" the X account End Wokeness posted  Nov. 11  along with a graph showing Democratic votes overtaking Republican votes around 4 a.m. on Nov. 6.   Conservative commentator Benny Johnson soon reshared a screengrab of the X post with his own all-caps  caption : ""Expose the fraud!!""

Then, at 4 a.m., Milwaukee reported approximately 108,000 absentee ballots, with Senator Baldwin receiving nearly 90% of those ballots. Statistically, this outcome seems improbable, as it didn’t match the patterns from same-day voting in Milwaukee where I received 22% of the votes."" These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) (Screenshots from Instagram) These claims are inaccurate. Wisconsin election experts told PolitiFact that this early morning influx of ballots was expected — and they not only don’t signal anything nefarious, they resulted from adherence to the law. That’s because state law does not allow election workers to process absentee ballots before Election Day — despite a  bipartisan push   to change  that law earlier this year. The claims echo  falsehoods   about the   2020 election , which included the same criticisms of Milwaukee’s early-morning  absentee ballot influxes . ""This is something that everybody who’s familiar with elections in Wisconsin understands will happen,"" said Jay Heck, executive director of the public advocacy group Common Cause Wisconsin. Wisconsin is  one of two swing states  — and one of  seven states total  — that does not begin to process absentee ballots before Election Day, he said.  The 4 a.m. influx of absentee ballots was ""only indicative"" of that, said Claire Woodall, a senior adviser at Issue One, a group advocating for transparency and clean government.  ""The ‘influx’ in the results was reflective of the number of absentee ballots that the City of Milwaukee tabulated and were known to still be outstanding at 8 p.m. on Election Night,"" she said.  Woodall, who served as the City of Milwaukee’s Election Commission executive director from 2020 to 2024, wrote in an email that ""results from Milwaukee’s Central Count have come in between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. every Presidential Election due to the restrictive state laws."" Milwaukee Central Count’s high speed tabulators also do not report ""partial reports,"" so the results of the ballots counted there are ""delivered in one fell swoop,"" Woodall said. ""All results must be exported onto encrypted flash drives and hand-delivered to Milwaukee County,"" Woodall said. ""This process cannot be completed until 100% of the absentee votes have been tabulated.""  As Milwaukee absentee ballots were tabulated Nov. 5, someone noticed that doors on the tabulator machines were  not fully secured . After consulting with Republican and Democratic officials, the Milwaukee Election Commission  said  it would restart tabulation at central count to be ""fully transparent"" and ""to eliminate any doubt.""  Ann Jacobs, chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in a series of Nov. 5 X posts that the tabulator machines were  zeroed out  and the previously tabulated ballots — about 34,000 ballots —  would be rerun  through the machines.  Tabulation so far. However, in the interest of transparency and so that people can have confidence in the tabulation, the decision was made to re-tabulate the ballots run through so far. That’s about 34,000 ballots give or take. So the machines are being zeroed out, and 2/ When mistakes happen, officials should ""acknowledge them, fix them"" and explain them,  she wrote , adding: ""So sorry my friends, it will be a very late night here in beautiful Milwaukee.""  A Milwaukee Election Commission  statement  said the city had ""no doubt regarding the integrity of the election."" As of Nov. 11, the commission’s updated statement said Milwaukee’s Board of Election Commissioners had certified the general election results.  After Hovde mentioned Milwaukee’s 4 a.m. election results, city election officials rebutted his claims in a  Nov. 11 Instagram post .  ""It is both expected and routine that absentee ballots — over 100,000 in this case — are counted and reported in the late hours of Election Night due to Wisconsin’s high voter turnout and the rigorous verification standards the MEC upholds,"" the Election Commission wrote. ""Unlike states led by both Republicans and Democrats that permit absentee ballots to be processed ahead of Election Day, Wisconsin does not, which can result in the reporting of large numbers of absentee ballots late at night.""  The Milwaukee Election Commission  called  Hovde’s claims ""baseless"" and said it was ""fully confident"" that his claims lacked merit.  Instagram posts claimed a 4 a.m. ""ballot dump"" in Milwaukee showed the Wisconsin U.S. Senate election was stolen from the Republican candidate. In Wisconsin, election officials can’t process absentee ballots early, so experts say it is routine for an influx of absentee ballot votes to be reported late at night or in the early morning hours after Election Day. Because of an error noticed during tabulation, Milwaukee also tabulated more than 30,000 ballots, further delaying the city’s election results.  Election experts rebutted claims that the 4 a.m. influx of results signaled election fraud or malfeasance.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

Baldwin received 88,229 absentee votes amounting to 80.9%; Hovde received 17,699 absentee votes, which is about 16.3%   Baldwin slightly outperformed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who received 80.6% of the absentee vote. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump received 17.1% of the absentee vote, outperforming Hovde.","Losing Wisconsin Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has, so far, refused to concede his loss to incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.  A week after Election Day, Hovde posted a five-minute video to his X account with his thoughts on the race. ""I believe it’s better not to comment until I have the facts,"" he said in the video’s first few seconds. ""Like many of my supporters, I was shocked by what unfolded on election night.""  Hovde also said that at 4 a.m. Milwaukee updated its count to include roughly 108,000 absentee ballots and that Baldwin won ""nearly 90% of those ballots."" ""Statistically, this outcome seems improbable,"" Hovde said, ""as it didn’t match the pattern from same-day voting in Milwaukee, where I received 22% of the vote.""   Let’s see if Hovde is correct.  Milwaukee received 108,964 absentee ballots by Nov. 5, according to the unofficial count.  Of that group, Baldwin received 88,229 and Hovde received 17,699 absentee ballots.  So, Baldwin got 80.9% of the absentee vote and Hovde got 16.2% of it.  Clearly, Baldwin did not get ""nearly 90%"" of the absentee ballot vote. In comparison, Baldwin slightly outperformed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris who received 87,852 absentee votes, or 80.6%. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outperformed Hovde by receiving 18,698 or 17.1%.  That pattern occurred throughout the state as Baldwin outperformed Harris and Hovde was not carried by Trump who ended up winning the state.  Hovde is claiming the absentee ballot pattern doesn’t match what he got on Election Day. So, let’s review what happened in Milwaukee on Election Day.  On Election Day itself, there were 140,043 votes cast in Milwaukee, according to the unofficial count. Of that number, Baldwin received 102,598 and Hovde received 29,574. So, Baldwin pulled down 73.2% of the vote on Election Day compared to Hovde’s 21.1% of that vote. That’s not quite 22%, as he said, but it’s closer than what he said Baldwin’s absentee vote was. Often, the same-day vote comes in at a different split than absentee votes because, traditionally, more Republicans vote on Election Day than earlier. And Republicans this year pushed for more of their supporters to vote absentee.  And the vote being counted early Wednesday morning shouldn’t have surprised Hovde, either.  Under Wisconsin law, absentee ballots cannot be processed before 7 a.m. on Election Day. The Republican-controlled state Senate earlier this year  let a bipartisan bill die  that would have enabled clerks to start processing absentee ballots the day before the election and therefore finish counting all the ballots at a more reasonable time on Election Day. And thus avoiding updating the results at 4 a.m. In suggesting there may be irregularities with the vote count, Hovde claimed Baldwin got ""nearly 90%"" of the absentee ballot vote in the city of Milwaukee.  According to the city’s results on its website, Baldwin got 80.9% of the vote, which is not ""nearly 90%.""  Our definition of False is ""the statement is not accurate.""

The same Threads account also  posted  a link to a Nov. 6 TikTok  video  that said, ""BREAKING: Biden has been asked to do an election recount on Trump’s victory."" The White House didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the post. Harris, meanwhile, has conceded the election. And we found no evidence, such as public statements from the White House or Biden or credible news coverage to support the claim that Biden has agreed to a recount.  State laws govern  processes for disputing election results, the Library of Congress  notes . Sometimes recounts are initiated automatically. In Pennsylvania, for example, the unofficial results in the U.S. Senate race Nov. 5  triggered a legally required statewide count  because they were within one-half of 1 percentage point.

politifact,"Says Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., “is trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes.”","As Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race headed to a recount, Republican Dave McCormick led Democratic Sen. Bob Casey by more than 16,000 votes, as of Nov. 19.     Casey challenged local boards’ decisions to reject some provisional ballots because the voters’ names weren’t found in the voter rolls. Casey’s campaign presented lists of voters to county officials the campaign believes are registered and said officials should recheck the official records.     Casey’s campaign has not asked for votes from noncitizens to be counted, and PolitiFact couldn’t find an example of provisional ballots being challenged because a noncitizen had cast them.","As Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race headed for a recount, the candidates’ campaigns battled over small batches of provisional ballots in counties statewide.  As of Nov. 19, about 16,400 votes separated Republican Dave McCormick from incumbent Sen. Bob Casey,  according to CNN . The Associated Press  called the race  for McCormick on Nov. 7, but Casey has not conceded. The race is within the 0.5% margin that triggers an  automatic recount  by state law. The counties must begin the recount by Nov. 20.  Some counties have already started  tabulating the 7 million paper ballots that will be recounted.  X owner Elon Musk, who  leveraged his massive wealth  this year to campaign for President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, accused Casey of trying to count the votes of noncitizens, who are legally barred from voting.  ""The Democratic Party senate candidate in Pennsylvania is trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes, which is illegal,"" Musk wrote  Nov. 13 on X .  This claim lacks evidence.  The Casey and McCormick campaigns have sparred over the validity of an estimated  60,000 provisional ballots  across Pennsylvania’s 67 counties.  Provisional ballots  are cast when voters’ eligibility to vote is in question — records may show that these people already voted, or are not registered in the correct county, or are not registered to vote at all.  After the election, county officials verify whether provisional ballots are valid. Ballots deemed valid are included in the final vote count; invalid ballots are thrown out. Campaigns can challenge decisions to accept or reject those ballots.  This process happens in every election in  nearly every state .  The Casey and McCormick campaigns have disagreed about whether to count provisional ballots. But so far, the citizenship of voters who cast provisional ballots isn’t in question.  PolitiFact reviewed public ballot  hearings  in Pennsylvania and examined  local reporting  on provisional ballot challenges. We found no instances of ballots being rejected because someone wasn’t a citizen, or because Casey’s campaign had asked officials to count known noncitizens’ votes. Local outlets reporting on Musk’s claim called it false. X’s press team did not respond to our query about Musk’s claim. McCormick’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. McCormick’s campaign manager,  Matt Gruda , has accused Casey’s campaign of trying to count unregistered voters, but neither Gruda nor the campaign has said publicly that noncitizens were voting. Casey’s campaign has broadly called for election officials to count as many provisional ballots as possible. That includes ballots missing poll workers’ signatures, voter information or secrecy envelopes.  Casey’s campaign also challenged the rejection of batches of ballots in counties in which voters’ names could not be found on the counties’ voter registration lists. The campaign asked officials to recheck the registration lists and said the ballots of voters with pending registrations should be accepted.  In many cases, the Casey campaign later reviewed those ballots and presented officials with ballots it believed had been mislabeled as coming from people who weren’t registered to vote. A Casey campaign lawyer, in a letter to Lackawanna County’s solicitor, said ballots should be accepted if the voters who cast them were registered in a different county but moved to and voted in a new county within the last 30 days. The attorney also said voters with pending registration statuses should be allowed to vote if their registration applications were valid, and added that counties should follow federal law when removing voters from voter rolls.  Gruda, McCormick’s campaign manager, has called these efforts an attempt to count the votes of people who are not registered to vote. He said in a Nov. 13  X post  that Casey is ""trying to illegally count UNREGISTERED voters as a way to cut into (McCormick’s) margin."" Gruda’s post is in the chain of X posts on which Musk commented, although the campaign did not mention noncitizens.  Casey’s campaign has denied calling for nonregistered voters’ ballots to be counted, and said it is asking officials not to reject votes from voters who are registered.  ""No one is trying to count votes from individuals who were not registered,"" Casey campaign lawyer Adam Bonin said. ""This is categorically false."" McCormick’s campaign has asked that ballots be rejected if the voters’ names aren’t on voter rolls. County officials have generally voted to throw those ballots out; some have said they will verify the status of voters Democrats identified as being registered.  In videos of provisional ballot hearings reviewed by PolitiFact, in  Philadelphia  and  Allegheny ,  Lancaster  and  Montgomery  counties, the issue of noncitizens casting ballots did not come up. And the letter from Casey’s campaign listing the reasons it asked for ballots to be counted did not include any reference to noncitizens.  James Allen, Delaware County’s elections director, said there was no dispute about noncitizen voters when the county reviewed provisional ballots.  ""We had hundreds and hundreds of challenges but we haven’t had one person say, ‘Ah, look at this, a group of noncitizens,’"" Allen said.  Allen said Musk, and other people who claimed noncitizens are voting, have not provided evidence that noncitizens voted in Pennsylvania.  The  Philadelphia Inquirer  reported that Seth Bluestein, a Republican commissioner in Philadelphia, said he did not see challenges in the city that were based on noncitizen voters. Pittsburgh radio station  WESA-FM reported  that Lackawanna County Solicitor Donald Frederickson Jr. said noncitizen voters were not an issue in his county, either. Musk said Casey is ""trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes, which is illegal."" The U.S. Senate candidates in Pennsylvania are dueling over whether provisional ballots in counties across the state are valid. In many cases, Casey’s campaign has challenged the rejection of ballots from voters who were not found on the counties’ voter rolls.  But Casey’s campaign has not asked for noncitizen votes to be counted. In the county meetings PolitiFact reviewed, noncitizen votes were not at issue. McCormick’s campaign has also not claimed Casey is trying to count noncitizen votes.  We rate the claim False.",false,Elon Musk,2024-11-13,2024-11-19,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP24310567912631/47d29810a30ba0e750cfc8b39bf28100.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/19/elon-musk/no-democrat-bob-casey-is-not-asking-to-count-nonci/,"Immigration, Elections, Pennsylvania, 2024 Senate Elections, Elon Musk"
politifact,"""Ballot dumps"" in Pennsylvania, California, North Carolina, Alaska and Wisconsin show election officials are improperly “flipping"" down-ballot seats for Democrats.","States have different laws regulating when and how ballots can be counted.      Provisional ballots must be verified after Election Day, and voters can correct errors in their ballots in many states.     These late changes to the vote totals aren’t evidence of fraud, but a sign the process is working as intended — state and local election officials are following the law, not subverting it.","Election officials continue to count ballots in many states two weeks out from the 2024 election, sparking unfounded theories about suspicious ""ballot dumps"" and accusations of election interference.  One Instagram user highlighted several states and districts in which late-counted votes favored Democrats, claiming election officials are ""flipping the down-ballot seats"" for Democrats.  ""There are still massive ballot dumps happening eleven days after the election,"" the person said in an  Instagram Reel  posted Nov. 18. ""They really thought we wouldn’t notice.""  Later in the video, she said, ""Since Trump won, they really thought we wouldn’t catch them flipping the down-ballot seats.""  The video featured X posts commenting on elections in  Pennsylvania ,  California ,  North Carolina ,  Wisconsin  and  Alaska . Some of those posts said corruption or election interference was to blame for the changing vote totals. Millions of ballots have been counted in the two weeks following the election, as officials have worked to verify vote totals and count ballots that were not counted or had not been received by Election Day. In some cases, votes in these close races have changed which candidate led.  But the late addition of votes doesn’t signal anything nefarious. Election experts told us these are a normal part of the election, and they show the process is working.  States have different rules for when officials can begin processing and counting mail-in ballots, and when ballots can be accepted, National Association of Election Officials Chief Programs Officer Tammy Patrick said. Voters in many states also have opportunities to fix errors in their ballots, and provisional ballots — which are cast when a person’s eligibility to vote is in question — need time to be verified and counted. Some states do not allow election officials to begin opening mail-in ballots to be counted until Election Day. Several states also accept absentee ballots that were postmarked by Election Day but arrived at the election office later.  ""It’s not evidence of fraud,"" said Jay Young, senior director of voting and democracy at Common Cause, a nonpartisan voting advocacy group. ""In fact, it’s evidence that election administrators are doing their job and making sure that every vote is counted — every eligible vote is counted, and all the ineligible votes aren’t."" Poll watchers from both parties and nonpartisan groups are also generally present when ballots are counted and certified, Young said, so late-counted ballots aren’t being tabulated in secret.   Vote tallies are unofficial and subject to change until a state officially certifies its vote total. In  most states , the certification deadline is more than two weeks after the November election. The Instagram video pointed to late ballot additions in some Pennsylvania counties, where Senate candidate Republican Dave McCormick and incumbent Democrat Sen. Bob Casey are fighting over the  eligibility of provisional ballots  and certain mail-in ballots. A state law-triggered recount in the U.S. Senate race is underway. Most of the votes in Pennsylvania were counted on election night, but in some large counties there were still thousands of absentee ballots that were counted after Election Day, and officials in every county had to adjudicate an estimated 60,000 provisional ballots. Provisional ballots require a hearing for county officials and campaigns to weigh in on whether they should be counted.  One post focused on  Bucks County , where Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s narrow lead shrank as ballots were counted. Bucks County officials voted Nov. 11 to count  mail ballots without dates  on their outer envelopes. Another post highlighted a ""5k ballot dump"" from  Montgomery County  that narrowed McCormick’s lead over Casey statewide. Montgomery County did add about 5,000 ballots to its count Nov. 16, according to  archived   results  from The New York Times’ website, but the addition was not unexpected.  Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija  said Nov. 6  there were an estimated 10,000 ballots yet to be counted, including mail-in ballots, military and overseas ballots and provisional ballots. Some counties decided to count absentee ballots  that lacked proper dates  despite previous state Supreme Court guidance saying those ballots should not be counted. The Supreme Court ruled again on Nov. 18 that mail-in ballots without proper dates should not be counted, and ordered counties not to include them in their totals. A Democrat taking the lead in a razor-thin California U.S. House race is also not a sign of election fraud. The Instagram video’s creator pointed to an  X post  that claimed ""there is NO WAY"" Democrat Derek Tran could have taken the lead in the 45th Congressional District race, calling California ""corrupt.""  Tran led by 397 votes over incumbent Republican Michelle Steel as of midday Nov. 21, according to the  California secretary of state’s office .  California has historically taken weeks to count ballots, so it’s unsurprising that ballots are being counted more than two weeks after Election Day. The state allows mailed absentee ballots that were postmarked by Election Day to be accepted up to seven days after the election, and it allows voters to correct or ""cure"" any errors on their ballots until two days before the election is certified Dec. 3.   Steel  led by  10,000 votes in the 45th District on Nov. 6, but Tran took the lead on  Nov. 16 , when Orange County counted 1,154 new ballots in the contest, with 54% of those votes going to Tran.  Los Angeles  and  Orange  counties have provided regular updates about the ballots left to be counted in the race, so it’s clear where the ballots are coming from.  ""There are chain of custody records that demonstrate when these were picked up from the post office, when they were received by the elections office,"" Patrick said. ""There’s chain of custody protocols that go through. And so it’s not the case that there’s anything new here, it’s just it takes a long time to process some of these after Election Day.""  Less than  1,000 votes  separated the North Carolina Supreme Court candidates as of Nov. 21, and Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin  requested a recount  Nov. 19.  Griffin led the count by about 10,000 votes shortly after the election, but the margin closed as additional ballots were counted the following week, and Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs now holds a narrow lead.  The Instagram video featured an  X post  that said Riggs overtaking Griffin is ""what stealing an Election looks like.""  Absentee ballots that arrived on Election Day, military and overseas absentee ballots that arrived by Nov. 14, and provisional ballots were all counted after Election Day and contributed to the margin changing. Voters in Hurricane Helene-affected areas were able to submit their absentee ballots to any county board of elections office this year, and those votes were also more likely to be counted after Election Day, North Carolina’s  Board of Elections  reported. On Nov. 19, Griffin filed election protests challenging more than 60,000 ballots, according to a North Carolina Republican Party  press release . The Raleigh-based  News & Observer  reported the protests argued counties had counted ballots from voters who were unregistered, had been serving felony sentences or who died before Election Day.   The State Board of Elections is asking lawyers for the campaigns to  provide more information , and asking counties to investigate specific claims to see if irregularities exist. But Riggs overtaking Griffin does not itself prove any problems with the count.  ""No, it’s not evidence that you should be concerned about the process; again, it’s evidence that you should be happy that the process is working as it was designed to,"" Young said. Another  X post  in the Instagram Reel from conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza alleged a 3 a.m. ""ballot dump"" lost Republicans the Wisconsin Senate race and said Republicans should ""sound the alarm.""  We fact-checked a similar claim that a late night influx of votes was evidence of fraud already, and rated it  Pants on Fire . Wisconsin election workers cannot begin processing absentee ballots before Election Day, so the early morning ballot tranche was expected. The addition represented ballots that were known to be tabulated in Milwaukee and had not yet been reported.  The video highlighted a Nov. 16  X post  that said Democrats had won a controlling coalition in Alaska’s House of Representatives, with the video’s creator questioning why ""only the Dems"" benefit from ""late ballot dumps.""  Alaska takes particularly long to count because of  unique factors : It’s geographically rural and has hard-to-reach towns that may slow mail delivery. The state allows absentee ballots to be received up to 10 days postelection.  Alaska’s  ranked-choice voting  system means it could take longer for a winner to be determined.  That the party in control of  Alaska’s House of Representatives  was not known until more than a week after the election reflects how Alaska counts ballots. It doesn’t signal election interference.  An Instagram video claimed ""ballot dumps"" showed election officials are improperly ""flipping"" elections for Democrats. A patchwork of state and local laws regulates how ballots are counted across the country, and each state has rules that affect how fast ballots are counted. Unprocessed absentee ballots, provisional ballots and late-arriving mail ballots are all more likely to be counted after Election Day.  The late additions of votes are a sign that every vote is being counted and states are following regular election procedures. These changing results are far from fraud; they reveal state and local election officials’ efforts to follow, not subvert, the law.

All of them have been mentioned in social media posts claiming they are leaving the country following the 2024 election. Although these artists have expressed support for Vice President and former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, none of them has publicly announced plans to leave the country. Nevertheless, social media posts declare otherwise.

These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Taylor Swift  and  Billie Eilish  were the subject of similar claims, which we rated False. Each of the artists named in these social media posts supported Harris during the campaign, but PolitiFact found no credible news stories reporting that any of these celebrities left the U.S. after the election. There is also no evidence that these artists have ceded any awards or nominations. Here’s what we know about each of them. Robert Downey Jr.:  The actor who played Iron Man in Marvel’s ""Avengers"" movies, joined a call  organized  by his co-star Mark Ruffalo, who played the Hulk, to support Harris along with other ""Avengers"" co-stars. Downey Jr.  posted  the video of the call on his Instagram account. The  post  about Downey Jr. also claims that he ""abandons new Marvel movie project,"" but there’s no evidence to support that. The Walt Disney Co.  said  in July that the actor will soon be playing  Doctor Doom , another ""Avengers"" character. John Legend:  The singer  publicly   supported  Harris in the 2024 election. In a September 2020  interview  with Cosmopolitan magazine, he commented on the idea of leaving the country, saying, ""Every once in a while, you think about it."" He also said, ""It would be hard to leave. But I don’t know what one’s supposed to do when you have a leader who is trying to destroy democracy."" Although one  post said  Legend ""refuses"" a Grammy nomination, we found no news coverage confirming that. Legend was  nominated  for two 2025 Grammys — for Best Children's Music Album for "" My Favorite Dream "" and Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella for ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" by Jacob Collier featuring Legend and singer Tori Kelly.  However, there is no evidence that he turned that comment into a real plan. Tom Hanks:  The actor joined a Sept. 25  conversation  along with filmmaker Ken Burns organized by the Harris campaign for fundraising purposes. Hanks also  urged  people to vote. Back in January 2021, Hanks  hosted  Joe Biden’s presidential inauguration concert. The  post  mentioning Hanks also claimed he ""withdraws Oscar nominations,"" but Oscar nominations for the 2025 ceremony, which will take place March 2, 2025, won’t be announced until Jan. 17, 2025. Therefore, Hanks couldn’t have withdrawn any nominations. Bruce Springsteen:  Springsteen  endorsed  Harris and  performed  at a Harris rally in Atlanta. In 2020, he  joked  about planning to leave the country if Trump was re-elected, but he has not announced any real plans to do so. Robert De Niro:  DeNiro, who has been  publicly critical  of Trump, in early November  said of Harris , ""(She’s) the only answer at this point, obviously, but she happens to be a great answer."" Some of these claims originated on pages that self-identified as satire. We found a  post  with the same claim about Hanks that included a note stating that it’s satire.

A Dec. 1  X post  showed a screenshot of a post Patel supposedly shared on the platform a day after Trump’s announcement. The post read, ""The FBI is gay and retarded."" (Screenshot from X) Although Patel has been critical of the FBI, this post is fake. PolitiFact searched  Patel’s X account , which was created Dec. 1, and found no such post about the FBI. We also found no news reports about Patel saying this. Patel, the child of Indian immigrants,  started his law career  as a public defender in Florida. He then worked as a federal prosecutor in the Justice Department before serving in national security and defense roles during the first Trump administration. As a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staff member, Patel helped lead the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was then tapped for roles in the Trump administration, including deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council and chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Patel has promised to make drastic changes to the FBI’s footprint if the Senate approves his nomination. In a  September interview  on the ""Shawn Ryan Show"" podcast, Patel said he would ""shut down"" the FBI’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., ""on Day 1 and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state.""

Their young sons, Beau, 4, and Hunter, 3, were seriously injured in the wreck. In January 1973, Beau and Hunter  were still recovering  from their injuries at a Wilmington, Delaware, hospital when it was time for Joe Biden to be sworn in to the Senate. Joe Biden asked the Senate for permission to take his oath of office at the hospital, rather than the U.S. Capitol, so he could remain with his children. Reporters and photographers documented the Jan. 5, 1975, ceremony. The Associated Press  took the photo  seen in the Facebook post, and the caption says the child pictured was Beau Biden, not Hunter.

politifact,"“Trump won 18-to-24-year-olds in Wisconsin.""","A CNN exit poll shows President-elect Donald Trump won 18-to-24-year-olds in Wisconsin     However, other exit polls show Vice President Kamala Harris winning 18-to-29-year-olds in Wisconsin     Experts say it can’t be determined which of these polls is ""right"" because exit polls are a snapshot in time.","President-elect Donald Trump won Wisconsin by nearly 30,000 votes after losing the state four years ago by some 20,000 votes, but did he really win 18-to-24-year-olds in the state? There have been a lot of different takes on how Trump took the state over Vice President Kamala Harris, but one in particular caught our eye: ""Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin,"" according to a Dec. 1, 2024, X post from Luc J. Gagnon @LakePoliticsYT.   Gagnon, according to his profile, is a ""progressive Republican"" and ""ballot chaser"" for Turning Point Action and Republican Party of Milwaukee County. The claim piqued PolitiFact Wisconsin’s interest because four years earlier, in 2020, in Wisconsin, 14% of all votes cast came from young voters, ages 18 to 29. Of these, 58% supported Joe Biden, while 39% backed Donald Trump, according to the  CIRCLE , which also estimated that young people turned out at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2016.  The impact of that demographic, especially youth of color’s support for Biden, was decisive in races across the country, according to the CIRCLE (the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement), which describes itself as a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement.  In his post, Gagnon included a table showing Trump winning 50% of the 18-to-24-year-old vote in Wisconsin, while Harris received 48%. Gagnon did not provide a source for his figures, and attempts to reach him for comment were not successful. However, a quick Google search finds that the figures originate from a Nov. 19, 2024,  CNN exit poll.     Gagnon’s  social media post  garnered 80.9K views and 2.1K likes on X. Thus, we are attributing the claim to social media for purposes of this fact check. Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, noting the figures were from CNN exit polling, pointed out that the post skipped the first age table for Wisconsin voters, which looks at a slightly different demographic: 18-to-29-year-old Wisconsin voters.  A closer look at that  group  shows Harris at 49% and Trump at 48%. The post instead goes for the narrower second one, 18-to-24, which indeed had Trump at 50% and Harris at 48%.  Franklin also pointed out that there is a quite different result from the data provided by AP-Votecast, which is used by Fox News. That data show a strong Harris win among 18-to-29-year-olds — 61% to 38% — but did not provide a breakdown for 18-to-24-year-olds. ""Which of these is ‘right’ is difficult to know,"" Franklin said in an email. ""Exit polls and the AP Votecast, are attempts to capture voter behavior at the moment of the election, but like all polls they are subject to sampling variability and to non-response issues. For small groups of the electorate (9% to 14% in this case in both polls) the potential for both sampling variation and non-response issues is greater than for larger groups.""  In other words, the smaller the group examined, the greater the margin of error. NORC is a nonprofit research organization at the University of Chicago that conducts a survey used by the Associated Press and Fox News under the brand AP VoteCast, which debuted in 2018.  NBC News  in explaining how exit polls work, said that since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks — ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News — that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation.  In the coming weeks and months there will be surveys from shortly after the election that are matched to the state voter files to give a measure of people who actually voted in the election, and their survey responses, Franklin said. Barry C. Burden, University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor and director of the university’s Elections Research Center, said there is not sufficiently reliable data to conclude which candidate got more votes among young people — or any other age group — in Wisconsin. ""Exit polls such as the one Gagnon references are the most immediate source for understanding how groups voted in the election, so they are widely used to explore voting patterns,"" Burden said in an email. ""But exit polls are known to have systematic errors, especially for estimating vote choices in subgroups such as 18-24 year olds, who make up a small share of the sample and can be a difficult group to survey. There is also a margin of error to consider, as in any other survey. As a result, it is not reasonable to conclude at this point that Trump won over young voters in Wisconsin."" Burden said more high-quality data analysis will not emerge until early 2025 because it simply takes time to gather data in more scientific surveys or to use official state voter data to estimate how individuals voted. ""At most we can conclude from exit polls that the vote choices of young voters in Wisconsin were probably more evenly divided between the parties than in recent elections,"" Burden said. A  Wisconsin Public Radio  report also noted that Trump made big gains in voting wards around universities, according to data compiled by Marquette University researcher John Johnson.  For example, WPR said, in four wards around the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Biden beat Trump by over 1,000 votes in 2020. This year, with over 4,000 votes cast, Harris eked out a mere 77-vote win. Also, WPR reported, Trump more than doubled his vote count in seven student-populated wards around Marquette University. He diminished Democrats’ winning margin there from 62% to 38%. A social media post said ""Trump won 18-24 year olds in Wisconsin.""  A CNN exit poll does indeed show Trump winning that age group over Harris 50% to 48%.  The CNN poll does show that, but the picture is muddier when you look at other polls, slightly wider groups and consider that the polls themselves have a wide margin of error for what amounts to a small slice of the electorate. Indeed, that same poll shows a different outcome when the demographic range is widened to ages 18 to 29, which shows Harris over Trump 49% to 48%. And looking at AP Votecast figures quoted by Fox News, Harris won 18-to-29-year-old Wisconsin voters at 61% while Trump received 38% of that demographic.  Elections experts say exit polls are known to have systematic errors, and more time is needed for high-quality data analysis to determine a better understanding of how Wisconsin’s young people voted in the election.  Still, those polls are the best information we have at this time and the post quoted the poll accurately.  For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate the post as Half True. ",half-true,Social Media,2024-12-01,2025-01-06,https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/Trump_leaves_Moisinee_WI_rally/0c1a45a545881330f6f1c3a4fd634795.jpg,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/06/social-media/poll-shows-trump-won-18-24-year-olds-in-wisconsin/,"National, Elections, Polls and Public Opinion, Wisconsin, Social Media"

Congress convened Jan. 6 to certify the presidential election results showing Donald Trump won.     Although litigation continues in a few contests, that doesn’t affect the presidential election’s certification.","On Jan. 6, Congress certified the results of the 2024 presidential election, affirming President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. A day later, however, Trump said the vote counting continues. ""We had a landslide election,"" Trump said at the Jan. 7  press conference at Mar-a-Lago , his private club in Palm Beach, Florida. ""We won every swing state. We won the popular vote by millions and millions of people. Nobody even knows how many people, millions, and they're still counting in some areas."" Trump said, ""We’ve got to fix the election so that we get honest counts and they get done by 10 o'clock in the evening or something thereabouts. There are places where they're still counting votes."" Trump’s comments create the impression that presidential race ballots are still being counted. We asked his presidential transition team for his evidence and got no reply. The votes have been counted. The states have certified the votes, the Electoral College has voted and Congress has accepted the results. States set deadlines to certify results in November or December. And we do know how many more people voted for Trump than voted for Vice President Kamala Harris — about 2.3 million — although the Electoral College, not the popular vote, determines the outcome. ""All the votes in the general election have been counted,"" said Mark Lindeman, policy and strategy director at Verified Voting, a nonprofit group with election technology expertise. ""All this is exactly how presidential elections are supposed to work."" California is often the last state to finish counting ballots because of its law’s long timelines and because it  mails ballots to all active voters . By law, its county elections officials have  30 days  to count ballots after Election Day. California’s secretary of state  certified  the statewide results Dec. 13. When federal lawmakers convened Jan. 6, they  read aloud  the tally of electoral votes from each state and  certified  the election results. ""I know of no place that hasn’t finished their initial count long ago,"" said David Becker. executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonpartisan organization that works with election officials from both political parties. It is possible for races with close margins to end in litigation months after Election Day — it took about eight months to resolve the  2008 Minnesota Senate  race. One prominent down-ballot race, for a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court, remains officially unsettled. That’s because the Republican candidate is challenging the certified results. On Jan. 7, the North Carolina Supreme Court, controlled 5-2 by Republican justices, blocked state election officials from certifying Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs as the winner. The court ruled that more time was needed to investigate claims by the Republican challenger, state appellate judge Jefferson Griffin, who is seeking to have more than 60,000 ballots tossed. WRAL,  PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner ,  reported  that the State Board of Elections in December rejected Griffin’s claims.  That litigation is unrelated to Trump’s victory. The North Carolina state board of elections  certified Trump’s win Nov. 26 . In Florida, litigation filed by the  Republican opponent of Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor  continues. Castor, who won about 57% of the vote, was sworn into Congress on Jan. 6. Certified state house races in  Minnesota  and  Georgia  also remain in litigation, according to Democracy Docket, a voting rights news platform that tracks election litigation. These lawsuits do not mean that election officials are still counting votes, it means they are fighting over election procedures or which votes should have been counted. Some states audit their results after the election, even after those results were officially finalized, said Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the National Association of Election Officials, a professional organization for state election directors. ""But they are not ‘still counting’ ballots in any jurisdiction in the union,"" Patrick said. Trump’s mention of a 10 p.m. deadline for counting harks back to his 2024 campaign calls to have  all ballots  counted on election night. Media outlets project election winners; when the margins are wide enough, they could make such calls comfortably on election night or the next day. But  state laws  — not the White House or Congress — dictate state processes that yield final, certified election results. Those laws include when mail ballots, including those from overseas service members, must be received and when election officials can start processing and tabulating ballots. If some states take longer to finish counting, it doesn’t signal wrongdoing.  Trump said, ""They’re still counting the (2024 election) vote in some areas."" He gave the impression that two months after Election Day, ballots are still being tabulated in the presidential race. That’s not happening. States certified their results by December, and Congress accepted the Electoral College results the day before Trump made this claim. Some state and local races remain under litigation, but that is not the same as counting ballots.
